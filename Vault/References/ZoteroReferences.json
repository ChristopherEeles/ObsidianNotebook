  {"id":"abbasFastDOGFastDiscrete2021","abstract":"We present a massively parallel Lagrange decomposition method for solving 0-1 integer linear programs occurring in structured prediction. We propose a new iterative update scheme for solving the Lagrangean dual and a perturbation technique for decoding primal solutions. For representing subproblems we follow Lange et al. (2021) and use binary decision diagrams (BDDs). Our primal and dual algorithms require little synchronization between subproblems and optimization over BDDs needs only elementary operations without complicated control flow. This allows us to exploit the parallelism offered by GPUs for all components of our method. We present experimental results on combinatorial problems from MAP inference for Markov Random Fields, quadratic assignment and cell tracking for developmental biology. Our highly parallel GPU implementation improves upon the running times of the algorithms from Lange et al. (2021) by up to an order of magnitude. In particular, we come close to or outperform some state-of-the-art specialized heuristics while being problem agnostic.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Abbas","given":"Ahmed"},{"family":"Swoboda","given":"Paul"}],"citation-key":"abbasFastDOGFastDiscrete2021","container-title":"arXiv:2111.10270 [cs, math]","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,19]]},"source":"arXiv.org","title":"FastDOG: Fast Discrete Optimization on GPU","title-short":"FastDOG","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.10270"},
  {"id":"abeshouseCOMPREHENSIVEINTEGRATEDGENOMIC2017","abstract":"Sarcomas are a broad family of mesenchymal malignancies exhibiting remarkable histologic diversity. We describe the multi-platform molecular landscape of 206 adult soft tissue sarcomas representing 6 major types. Along with novel insights into the biology of individual sarcoma types, we report three overarching findings: 1) unlike most epithelial malignancies, these sarcomas (excepting synovial sarcoma) are characterized predominantly by copy number changes, with low mutational loads and only a few genes (TP53, ATRX, RB1) highly recurrently mutated across sarcoma types, 2) within sarcoma types, genomic and regulomic diversity of driver pathways defines molecular subtypes associated with patient outcome, and 3) the immune microenvironment, inferred from DNA methylation and mRNA profiles, associates with outcome and may inform clinical trials of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Overall, this large-scale analysis reveals previously unappreciated sarcoma type-specific changes in copy number, methylation, RNA, and protein, providing insights into refining sarcoma therapy and relationships to other cancer types., \n, Genetic analysis of soft tissue sarcomas shows that they are characterized predominantly by copy number changes and offers insights into the immune microenviroment to inform clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Abeshouse","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Adebamowo","given":"Clement"},{"family":"Adebamowo","given":"Sally

Identifying the best treatment using computational models to personalize drug response prediction holds great promise to improve patient’s chances of successful recovery. Unfortunately, the computational task of predicting drug response is very challenging, partially due to the limitations of the available data and partially due to algorithmic shortcomings. The recent advances in deep learning may open a new chapter in the search for computational drug response prediction models and ultimately result in more accurate tools for therapy response. This review provides an overview of the computational challenges and advances in drug response prediction, and focuses on comparing the machine learning techniques to be of utmost practical use for clinicians and machine learning non-experts. The incorporation of new data modalities such as single-cell profiling, along with techniques that rapidly find effective drug combinations will likely be instrumental in improving cancer care.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,4,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Adam","given":"George"},{"family":"Rampášek","given":"Ladislav"},{"family":"Safikhani","given":"Zhaleh"},{"family":"Smirnov","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Haibe-Kains","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Goldenberg","given":"Anna"}],"citation-key":"adamMachineLearningApproaches2020","container-title":"npj Precision Oncology","container-title-short":"npj Precis.

  {"id":"akhanliComparingClusteringsNumbers2020","abstract":"A key issue in cluster analysis is the choice of an appropriate clustering method and the determination of the best number of clusters. Different clusterings are optimal on the same data set according to different criteria, and the choice of such criteria depends on the context and aim of clustering. Therefore, researchers need to consider what data analytic characteristics the clusters they are aiming at are supposed to have, among others within-cluster homogeneity, between-clusters separation, and stability. Here, a set of internal clustering validity indexes measuring different aspects of clustering quality is proposed, including some indexes from the literature. Users can choose the indexes that are relevant in the application at hand. In order to measure the overall quality of a clustering (for comparing clusterings from different methods and/or different numbers of clusters), the index values are calibrated for aggregation. Calibration is relative to a set of random clusterings on the same data. Two specific aggregated indexes are proposed and compared with existing indexes on simulated and real data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Akhanli","given":"Serhat Emre"},{"family":"Hennig","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"akhanliComparingClusteringsNumbers2020","container-title":"Statistics and Computing","container-title-short":"Stat Comput","DOI":"10.1007/s11222-020-09958-2","ISSN":"1573-1375","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,9,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1523-1544","source":"Springer Link","title":"Comparing clusterings and numbers of clusters by aggregation of calibrated clustering validity indexes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11222-020-09958-2","volume":"30"},
  {"id":"alexandrovRepertoireMutationalSignatures2020","abstract":"Somatic mutations in cancer genomes are caused by multiple mutational processes, each of which generates a characteristic mutational signature1. Here, as part of the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium2 of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we characterized mutational signatures using 84,729,690 somatic mutations from 4,645 whole-genome and 19,184 exome sequences that encompass most types of cancer. We identified 49 single-base-substitution, 11 doublet-base-substitution, 4 clustered-base-substitution and 17 small insertion-and-deletion signatures. The substantial size of our dataset, compared with previous analyses3–15, enabled the discovery of new signatures, the separation of overlapping signatures and the decomposition of signatures into components that may represent associated—but distinct—DNA damage, repair and/or replication mechanisms. By estimating the contribution of each signature to the mutational catalogues of individual cancer genomes, we revealed associations of signatures to exogenous or endogenous exposures, as well as to defective DNA-maintenance processes. However, many signatures are of unknown cause. This analysis provides a systematic perspective on the repertoire of mutational processes that contribute to the development of human cancer.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Alexandrov","given":"Ludmil B."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jaegil"},{"family":"Haradhvala","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Huang","given":"Mi Ni"},{"family":"Tian Ng","given":"Alvin Wei"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Yang"},{"family":"Boot","given":"Arnoud"},{"family":"Covington","given":"Kyle R."},{"family":"Gordenin","given":"Dmitry A."},{"family":"Bergstrom","given":"Erik N."},{"family":"Islam","given":"S.

Currently, LMS treatment is not informed by molecular subtyping and is associated with highly variable survival. While disease site continues to dictate clinical management, the contribution of genetic factors to LMS subtype, origins, and timing are unknown. Here we analyze 70 genomes and 130 transcriptomes of LMS, including multiple tumor regions and paired metastases. Molecular profiling highlight the very early origins of LMS. We uncover three specific subtypes of LMS that likely develop from distinct lineages of smooth muscle cells. Of these, dedifferentiated LMS with high immune infiltration and tumors primarily of gynecological origin harbor genomic dystrophin deletions and/or loss of dystrophin expression, acquire the highest burden of genomic mutation, and are associated with worse survival. Homologous recombination defects lead to genome-wide mutational signatures, and a corresponding sensitivity to PARP trappers and other DNA damage response inhibitors, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for LMS. Finally, by phylogenetic reconstruction, we present evidence that clones seeding lethal metastases arise decades prior to LMS diagnosis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Anderson","given":"Nathaniel D."},{"family":"Babichev","given":"Yael"},{"family":"Fuligni","given":"Fabio"},{"family":"Comitani","given":"Federico"},{"family":"Layeghifard","given":"Mehdi"},{"family":"Venier","given":"Rosemarie E."},{"family":"Dentro","given":"Stefan C."},{"family":"Maheshwari","given":"Anant"},{"family":"Guram","given":"Sheena"},{"family":"Wunker","given":"Claire"},{"family":"Thompson","given":"J.

Variations in drug pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) can be, in part, explained by polymorphic variants in genes encoding drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) or in genes encoding drug receptors. Pharmacogenomics (PGx) has allowed the identification of predictive biomarkers of drug PKs and PDs and the current knowledge of genome-disease and genome-drug interactions offers the opportunity to optimize tailored drug therapy. High-throughput PGx genotyping, from targeted to more comprehensive strategies, allows the identification of PK/PD genotypes to be developed as clinical predictive biomarkers. However, a biomarker needs a robust process of validation followed by clinical-grade assay development and must comply to stringent regulatory guidelines.

In this review, the model attributes of published quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling for lowering cholesterol, treating salt-sensitive hypertension, and treating rare diseases as well as describing bone homeostasis and related pharmacological effects are critically reviewed with respect to model quality, calibration, validation, and performance. We further reviewed the common practices in optimizing QSP modeling and prediction. Notably, leveraging genetics and genomic studies for model calibration and validation is common. Statistical and quantitative assessment of QSP prediction and handling of model uncertainty are, however, mostly lacking as are the quantitative and statistical criteria for assessing QSP predictions and the covariance matrix of coefficients between the parameters in a validated virtual population. To accelerate advances and application of QSP with consistent quality, a list of key questions is proposed to be addressed when assessing the quality of a QSP model in hopes of stimulating the scientific community to set common expectations. The common expectations as to what constitutes the best QSP modeling practices, which the scientific community supports, will advance QSP modeling in the realm of informed drug development. In the long run, good practices will extend the life cycles of QSP models beyond the life cycles of individual drugs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bai","given":"Jane P.

Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust preclinical model systems that reflect the genomic diversity of human cancers and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological annotation is available. Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE): a compilation of gene expression, chromosomal copy number and massively parallel sequencing data from 947 human cancer cell lines. When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 anticancer drugs across 479 of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of genetic, lineage, and gene-expression-based predictors of drug sensitivity. In addition to known predictors, we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to IGF1 receptor inhibitors; AHR expression was associated with MEK inhibitor efficacy in NRAS-mutant lines; and SLFN11 expression predicted sensitivity to topoisomerase inhibitors. Together, our results indicate that large, annotated cell-line collections may help to enable preclinical stratification schemata for anticancer agents. The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the preclinical setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of 'personalized' therapeutic regimens.","author":[{"family":"Barretina","given":"Jordi"},{"family":"Caponigro","given":"Giordano"},{"family":"Stransky","given":"Nicolas"},{"family":"Venkatesan","given":"Kavitha"},{"family":"Margolin","given":"Adam A."},{"family":"Kim","given":"Sungjoon"},{"family":"Wilson","given":"Christopher J."},{"family":"Lehár","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Kryukov","given":"Gregory V."},{"family":"Sonkin","given":"Dmitriy"},{"family":"Reddy","given":"Anupama"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Manway"},{"family":"Murray","given":"Lauren"},{"family":"Berger","given":"Michael F."},{"family":"Monahan","given":"John E."},{"family":"Morais","given":"Paula"},{"family":"Meltzer","given":"Jodi"},{"family":"Korejwa","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Jané-Valbuena","given":"Judit"},{"family":"Mapa","given":"Felipa A."},{"family":"Thibault","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Bric-Furlong","given":"Eva"},{"family":"Raman","given":"Pichai"},{"family":"Shipway","given":"Aaron"},{"family":"Engels","given":"Ingo H."},{"family":"Cheng","given":"Jill"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Guoying K."},{"family":"Yu","given":"Jianjun"},{"family":"Aspesi","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Melanie","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Jagtap","given":"Kalpana"},{"family":"Jones","given":"Michael D."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Li"},{"family":"Hatton","given":"Charles"},{"family":"Palescandolo","given":"Emanuele"},{"family":"Gupta","given":"Supriya"},{"family":"Mahan","given":"Scott"},{"family":"Sougnez","given":"Carrie"},{"family":"Onofrio","given":"Robert C."},{"family":"Liefeld","given":"Ted"},{"family":"MacConaill","given":"Laura"},{"family":"Winckler","given":"Wendy"},{"family":"Reich","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Li","given":"Nanxin"},{"family":"Mesirov","given":"Jill P."},{"family":"Gabriel","given":"Stacey B."},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Ardlie","given":"Kristin"},{"family":"Chan","given":"Vivien"},{"family":"Myer","given":"Vic E."},{"family":"Weber","given":"Barbara L."},{"family":"Porter","given":"Jeff"},{"family":"Warmuth","given":"Markus"},{"family":"Finan","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Harris","given":"Jennifer L."},{"family":"Meyerson","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Golub","given":"Todd R."},{"family":"Morrissey","given":"Michael P."},{"family":"Sellers","given":"William R."},{"family":"Schlegel","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Garraway","given":"Levi A."}],"citation-key":"barretinaCancerCellLine2012","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/nature11003","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7391","issued":{"date-parts":[[2012,3,28]]},"language":"eng","page":"603-607","PMCID":"PMC3320027","PMID":"22460905","source":"PubMed","title":"The Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia enables predictive modelling of anticancer drug sensitivity","type":"article-journal","volume":"483"},

  {"id":"ben-davidGeneticTranscriptionalEvolution2018","abstract":"Human cancer cell lines are the workhorse of cancer research. Although cell lines are known to evolve in culture, the extent of the resultant genetic and transcriptional heterogeneity and its functional consequences remain understudied. Here we use genomic analyses of 106 human cell lines grown in two laboratories to show extensive clonal diversity. Further comprehensive genomic characterization of 27 strains of the common breast cancer cell line MCF7 uncovered rapid genetic diversification. Similar results were obtained with multiple strains of 13 additional cell lines. Notably, genetic changes were associated with differential activation of gene expression programs and marked differences in cell morphology and proliferation. Barcoding experiments showed that cell line evolution occurs as a result of positive clonal selection that is highly sensitive to culture conditions. Analyses of single-cell-derived clones demonstrated that continuous instability quickly translates into heterogeneity of the cell line. When the 27 MCF7 strains were tested against 321 anti-cancer compounds, we uncovered considerably different drug responses: at least 75% of compounds that strongly inhibited some strains were completely inactive in others. This study documents the extent, origins and consequences of genetic variation within cell lines, and provides a framework for researchers to measure such variation in efforts to support maximally reproducible cancer research.","author":[{"family":"Ben-David","given":"Uri"},{"family":"Siranosian","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Ha","given":"Gavin"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Oren","given":"Yaara"},{"family":"Hinohara","given":"Kunihiko"},{"family":"Strathdee","given":"Craig A."},{"family":"Dempster","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Lyons","given":"Nicholas J."},{"family":"Burns","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Nag","given":"Anwesha"},{"family":"Kugener","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Cimini","given":"Beth"},{"family":"Tsvetkov","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Maruvka","given":"Yosef E."},{"family":"O'Rourke","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Garrity","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Tubelli","given":"Andrew A."},{"family":"Bandopadhayay","given":"Pratiti"},{"family":"Tsherniak","given":"Aviad"},{"family":"Vazquez","given":"Francisca"},{"family":"Wong","given":"Bang"},{"family":"Birger","given":"Chet"},{"family":"Ghandi","given":"Mahmoud"},{"family":"Thorner","given":"Aaron R."},{"family":"Bittker","given":"Joshua A."},{"family":"Meyerson","given":"Matthew"},{"family":"Getz","given":"Gad"},{"family":"Beroukhim","given":"Rameen"},{"family":"Golub","given":"Todd R."}],"citation-key":"ben-davidGeneticTranscriptionalEvolution2018","container-title":"Nature","container-title-short":"Nature","DOI":"10.1038/s41586-018-0409-3","ISSN":"1476-4687","issue":"7718","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,8]]},"language":"eng","page":"325-330","PMCID":"PMC6522222","PMID":"30089904","source":"PubMed","title":"Genetic and transcriptional evolution alters cancer cell line drug response","type":"article-journal","volume":"560"},
  {"id":"brennerProjectedEstimatesCancer2020","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Cancer projections to the current year help in policy development, planning of programs and allocation of resources. We sought to provide an overview of the expected incidence and mortality of cancer in Canada in 2020 in follow-up to the Canadian Cancer Statistics 2019 report.\nMETHODS: We obtained incidence data from the National Cancer Incidence Reporting System (1984–1991) and Canadian Cancer Registry (1992–2015). Mortality data (1984–2015) were obtained from the Canadian Vital Statistics — Death Database. All databases are maintained by Statistics Canada. Cancer incidence and mortality counts and age-standardized rates were projected to 2020 for 23 cancer types by sex and geographic region (provinces and territories) for all ages combined.\nRESULTS: An estimated 225 800 new cancer cases and 83 300 cancer deaths are expected in Canada in 2020. The most commonly diagnosed cancers are expected to be lung overall (29 800), breast in females (27 400) and prostate in males (23 300). Lung cancer is also expected to be the leading cause of cancer death, accounting for 25.5% of all cancer deaths, followed by colorectal (11.6%), pancreatic (6.4%) and breast (6.1%) cancers. Incidence and mortality rates will be generally higher in the eastern provinces than in the western provinces.\nINTERPRETATION: The number of cancer cases and deaths remains high in Canada and, owing to the growing and aging population, is expected to continue to increase. Although progress has been made in reducing deaths for most major cancers (breast, prostate and lung), there has been limited progress for pancreatic cancer, which is expected to be the third leading cause of cancer death in Canada in 2020. Additional efforts to improve uptake of existing programs, as well as to advance research, prevention, screening and treatment, are needed to address the cancer burden in Canada.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Brenner","given":"Darren R."},{"family":"Weir","given":"Hannah K."},{"family":"Demers","given":"Alain A."},{"family":"Ellison","given":"Larry F."},{"family":"Louzado","given":"Cheryl"},{"family":"Shaw","given":"Amanda"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Donna"},{"family":"Woods","given":"Ryan R."},{"family":"Smith","given":"Leah M."}],"citation-key":"brennerProjectedEstimatesCancer2020","container-title":"CMAJ","DOI":"10.1503/cmaj.191292","ISSN":"0820-3946, 1488-2329","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,2]]},"language":"en","number":"9","page":"E199-E205","PMID":"32122974","publisher":"CMAJ","section":"Research","source":"www.cmaj.ca","title":"Projected estimates of cancer in Canada in 2020","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.cmaj.ca/content/192/9/E199","volume":"192"},

However, this approach is costly as it requires sequencing coverage over the entire genome. Here we introduce Anchor-Based Bisulfite Sequencing (ABBS). ABBS captures accurate DNA methylation information in Escherichia coli and mammals, while requiring up to 10 times fewer sequencing reads than WGBS. ABBS interrogates the entire genome and is not restricted to the CpG islands assayed by methods like Reduced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS). The ABBS protocol is simple and can be performed in a single day., Anchor-Based Bisulfite Sequencing (ABBS) is a sequencing based method that enables analysis of DNA methylation states, based on specific hybridization of bisulfite-refractory methylcytosines with 8-aza-7-deaza-2-deoxyguanosine, incorporated in a primer at the end of 5 random nucleotides.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Chapin","given":"Nathaniel"},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Joseph"},{"family":"Poole","given":"Jason"},{"family":"Delatte","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"chapinAnchorbasedBisulfiteSequencing2022","container-title":"Communications Biology","container-title-short":"Commun Biol","DOI":"10.1038/s42003-022-03543-1","ISSN":"2399-3642","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,16]]},"page":"596","PMCID":"PMC9203462","PMID":"35710818","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Anchor-based bisulfite sequencing determines genome-wide DNA methylation","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9203462/","volume":"5"},
  {"id":"chenPARPInhibitorsIts2011","abstract":"PARP is an important protein in DNA repair pathways especially the base excision repair (BER). BER is involved in DNA repair of single strand breaks (SSBs). If BER is impaired, inhibiting poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), SSBs accumulate and become double stand breaks (DSBs). The cells with increasing number of DSBs become more dependent on other repair pathways, mainly the homologous recombination (HR) and the nonhomologous end joining. Patients with defective HR, like BRCA-deficient cell lines, are even more susceptible to impairment of the BER pathway. Inhibitors of PARP preferentially kill cancer cells in BRCA-mutation cancer cell lines over normal cells. Also, PARP inhibitors increase cytotoxicity by inhibiting repair in the presence of chemotherapies that induces SSBs. These two principles have been tested clinically. Over the last few years, excitement over this class of agents has escalated due to reported activity as single agent in BRCA1- or BRCA2-associated ovarian or breast cancers, and in combination with chemotherapy in triple negative breast cancer. This review covers the current results of clinical trials testing those two principles. It also evaluates future directions for the field of PARP inhibitor development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Alice"}],"citation-key":"chenPARPInhibitorsIts2011","container-title":"Chinese Journal of Cancer","container-title-short":"Chin J Cancer","DOI":"10.5732/cjc.011.10111","ISSN":"1000-467X","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2011,7]]},"page":"463-471","PMCID":"PMC4013421","PMID":"21718592","source":"PubMed Central","title":"PARP inhibitors: its role in treatment of cancer","title-short":"PARP inhibitors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4013421/","volume":"30"},

The mechanisms underlying LMS development, including clinically actionable genetic vulnerabilities, are largely unknown. Here we show, using whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing, that LMS tumors are characterized by substantial mutational heterogeneity, near-universal inactivation of TP53 and RB1, widespread DNA copy number alterations including chromothripsis, and frequent whole-genome duplication. Furthermore, we detect alternative telomere lengthening in 78% of cases and identify recurrent alterations in telomere maintenance genes such as ATRX, RBL2, and SP100, providing insight into the genetic basis of this mechanism. Finally, most tumors display hallmarks of “BRCAness”, including alterations in homologous recombination DNA repair genes, multiple structural rearrangements, and enrichment of specific mutational signatures, and cultured LMS cells are sensitive towards olaparib and cisplatin. This comprehensive study of LMS genomics has uncovered key biological features that may inform future experimental research and enable the design of novel therapies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Chudasama","given":"Priya"},{"family":"Mughal","given":"Sadaf S."},{"family":"Sanders","given":"Mathijs A."},{"family":"Hübschmann","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Chung","given":"Inn"},{"family":"Deeg","given":"Katharina I."},{"family":"Wong","given":"Siao-Han"},{"family":"Rabe","given":"Sophie"},{"family":"Hlevnjak","given":"Mario"},{"family":"Zapatka","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Ernst","given":"Aurélie"},{"family":"Kleinheinz","given":"Kortine"},{"family":"Schlesner","given":"Matthias"},{"family":"Sieverling","given":"Lina"},{"family":"Klink","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Schröck","given":"Evelin"},{"family":"Hoogenboezem","given":"Remco M."},{"family":"Kasper","given":"Bernd"},{"family":"Heilig","given":"Christoph E."},{"family":"Egerer","given":"Gerlinde"},{"family":"Wolf","given":"Stephan"},{"family":"Kalle","given":"Christof","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Eils","given":"Roland"},{"family":"Stenzinger","given":"Albrecht"},{"family":"Weichert","given":"Wilko"},{"family":"Glimm","given":"Hanno"},{"family":"Gröschel","given":"Stefan"},{"family":"Kopp","given":"Hans-Georg"},{"family":"Omlor","given":"Georg"},{"family":"Lehner","given":"Burkhard"},{"family":"Bauer","given":"Sebastian"},{"family":"Schimmack","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Ulrich","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Mechtersheimer","given":"Gunhild"},{"family":"Rippe","given":"Karsten"},{"family":"Brors","given":"Benedikt"},{"family":"Hutter","given":"Barbara"},{"family":"Renner","given":"Marcus"},{"family":"Hohenberger","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Scholl","given":"Claudia"},{"family":"Fröhling","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"chudasamaIntegrativeGenomicTranscriptomic2018","container-title":"Nature Communications","container-title-short":"Nat Commun","DOI":"10.1038/s41467-017-02602-0","ISSN":"2041-1723","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,10]]},"language":"en","note":"Bandiera_abtest: a\nCc_license_type: cc_by\nCg_type: Nature Research Journals\nPrimary_atype: Research\nSubject_term: Cancer genomics;Sarcoma\nSubject_term_id: cancer-genomics;sarcoma","number":"1","page":"144","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www-nature-com.ezproxy.lib.ryerson.ca","title":"Integrative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of leiomyosarcoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02602-0","volume":"9"},

Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation.

  {"id":"ComputationalEstimationQuality2022","abstract":"Abstract Immortal cancer cell lines (CCLs) are the most widely used system for investigating cancer biology and for the preclinical development of oncology therapies. Pharmacogenomic and genome-wide editing screenings have facilitated the discovery of clinically relevant gene?drug interactions and novel therapeutic targets via large panels of extensively characterised CCLs. However, tailoring pharmacological strategies in a precision medicine context requires bridging the existing gaps between tumours and in?vitro models. Indeed, intrinsic limitations of CCLs such as misidentification, the absence of tumour microenvironment and genetic drift have highlighted the need to identify the most faithful CCLs for each primary tumour while addressing their heterogeneity, with the development of new models where necessary. Here, we discuss the most significant limitations of CCLs in representing patient features, and we review computational methods aiming at systematically evaluating the suitability of CCLs as tumour proxies and identifying the best patient representative in?vitro models. Additionally, we provide an overview of the applications of these methods to more complex models and discuss future machine-learning-based directions that could resolve some of the arising discrepancies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,14]]},"citation-key":"ComputationalEstimationQuality2022","container-title":"Molecular Systems Biology","DOI":"10.15252/msb.202211017","ISSN":"1744-4292","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7]]},"page":"e11017","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Ltd","source":"embopress.org (Atypon)","title":"Computational estimation of quality and clinical relevance of cancer cell lines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.202211017","volume":"18"},

Germline mutations in the BRCA 1/2 genes are the most well-known mechanisms of homologous recombination deficiency. However, other mechanisms, such as germline and somatic mutations in other homologous recombination genes and epigenetic modifications, have also been implicated in homologous recombination deficiency. The epidemiology and implications of these other mechanisms need to be better understood to improve the treatment strategies for these patients. Furthermore, an evaluation of various diagnostic tests to investigate homologous recombination deficiency is essential. Comprehension of the role of homologous recombination deficiency in ovarian cancer also allows the development of therapeutic combinations that can improve the efficacy of treatment.

  {"id":"danchevEvaluationDataSharing2021","abstract":"The benefits of responsible sharing of individual-participant data (IPD) from clinical studies are well recognized, but stakeholders often disagree on how to align those benefits with privacy risks, costs, and incentives for clinical trialists and sponsors. The International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) required a data sharing statement (DSS) from submissions reporting clinical trials effective July 1, 2018. The required DSSs provide a window into current data sharing rates, practices, and norms among trialists and sponsors.To evaluate the implementation of the ICMJE DSS requirement in 3 leading medical journals: JAMA, Lancet, and New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).This is a cross-sectional study of clinical trial reports published as articles in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM between July 1, 2018, and April 4, 2020. Articles not eligible for DSS, including observational studies and letters or correspondence, were excluded. A MEDLINE/PubMed search identified 487 eligible clinical trials in JAMA (112 trials), Lancet (147 trials), and NEJM (228 trials). Two reviewers evaluated each of the 487 articles independently.Publication of clinical trial reports in an ICMJE medical journal requiring a DSS.The primary outcomes of the study were declared data availability and actual data availability in repositories. Other captured outcomes were data type, access, and conditions and reasons for data availability or unavailability. Associations with funding sources were examined.A total of 334 of 487 articles (68.6%; 95% CI, 64%-73%) declared data sharing, with nonindustry NIH-funded trials exhibiting the highest rates of declared data sharing (89%; 95% CI, 80%-98%) and industry-funded trials the lowest (61%; 95% CI, 54%-68%). However, only 2 IPD sets (0.6%; 95% CI, 0.0%-1.5%) were actually deidentified and publicly available as of April 10, 2020. The remaining were supposedly accessible via request to authors (143 of 334 articles [42.8%]), repository (89 of 334 articles [26.6%]), and company (78 of 334 articles [23.4%]). Among the 89 articles declaring that IPD would be stored in repositories, only 17 (19.1%) deposited data, mostly because of embargo and regulatory approval. Embargo was set in 47.3% of data-sharing articles (158 of 334), and in half of them the period exceeded 1 year or was unspecified.Most trials published in JAMA, Lancet, and NEJM after the implementation of the ICMJE policy declared their intent to make clinical data available. However, a wide gap between declared and actual data sharing exists. To improve transparency and data reuse, journals should promote the use of unique pointers to data set location and standardized choices for embargo periods and access requirements.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Danchev","given":"Valentin"},{"family":"Min","given":"Yan"},{"family":"Borghi","given":"John"},{"family":"Baiocchi","given":"Mike"},{"family":"Ioannidis","given":"John P.

  {"id":"dangAssessingEfficacySafety2020","abstract":"Background Fecal microbiota transplantation is an effective treatment for many gastrointestinal diseases, such as Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis. Changes in colonic microflora may play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and improvements in the intestinal microflora may relieve the disease. Fecal bacterial transplants and oral probiotics are becoming important ways to relieve active ulcerative colitis. Purpose This systematic review with meta-analysis compared the efficacy and safety of basic treatment combined with fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics therapy in relieving mild to moderate ulcerative colitis. Methods The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane libraries (updated September 2019) were searched to identify randomized, placebo-controlled, or head-to-head trials assessing fecal microbiota transplantation or probiotic VSL#3 as induction therapy in active ulcerative colitis. We analyze data using the R program to obtain evidence of direct comparison and to generate intermediate variables for indirect treatment comparisons. Results Seven randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were used as the sources of the induction data. All treatments were superior to placebo. In terms of clinical remission and clinical response to active ulcerative colitis, direct comparisons showed fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 3.47, 95% CI = 1.93–6.25) (OR = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.18–5.21) and mixed probiotics VSL#3 (OR = 2.40, 95% CI = 1.49–3.88) (OR = 3.09, 95% CI = 1.53–6.25) to have better effects than the placebo. Indirect comparison showed fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic VSL#3 did not reach statistical significance either in clinical remission (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.70–2.06) or clinical response (RR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.62–1.45). In terms of safety, fecal microbiota transplantation (OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 0.51–2.61) and VSL #3 (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.33–2.49) showed no statistically significant increase in adverse events compared with the control group. In terms of serious adverse events, there was no statistical difference between the fecal microbiota transplantation group and the control group (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 0.46–3.57). The probiotics VSL#3 seems more safer than fecal microbiota transplantation, because serious adverse events were not reported in the VSL#3 articles. Conclusions Fecal microbiota transplantation or mixed probiotics VSL#3 achieved good results in clinical remission and clinical response in active ulcerative colitis, and there was no increased risk of adverse reactions. There was no statistical difference between the therapeutic effect of fecal microbiota transplantation and that of mixed probiotics VSL#3. However, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotics still has many unresolved problems in clinical applications, and more randomized controlled trials are required to confirm its efficacy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Dang","given":"Xiaofei"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Mingjie"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Duanrui"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Dajie"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Weihua"}],"citation-key":"dangAssessingEfficacySafety2020","container-title":"PLOS ONE","container-title-short":"PLOS ONE","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0228846","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,3,17]]},"language":"en","page":"e0228846","publisher":"Public Library of Science","source":"PLoS Journals","title":"Assessing the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic VSL#3 for active ulcerative colitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Assessing the efficacy and safety of fecal microbiota transplantation and probiotic VSL#3 for active ulcerative colitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0228846","volume":"15"},

We evaluated each stage of the ctDNA sequencing workflow with simulations, synthetic DNA spike-in experiments and proficiency testing on standardized, cell-line-derived reference samples. Above 0.5% variant allele frequency, ctDNA mutations were detected with high sensitivity, precision and reproducibility by all five assays, whereas, below this limit, detection became unreliable and varied widely between assays, especially when input material was limited. Missed mutations (false negatives) were more common than erroneous candidates (false positives), indicating that the reliable sampling of rare ctDNA fragments is the key challenge for ctDNA assays.

  {"id":"dhillonTherapeuticApplicationsProbiotics2020","abstract":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory disorder limited to colon and rectum. UC carries considerable burden and causes mortality of many patients so there is a continuous challenge for new advancements to be made in the present medical therapies. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are intended to have health benefits when consumed or applied to the body. Probiotic bacteria plays a crucial role in maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis, strengthening of gut barrier function and host immune responses. Thus, in order to combat chronic inflammation during UC and to improve quality of life in patients, probiotic supplementation is emerging as a therapeutic option of great interest.

UC carries considerable burden and causes mortality of many patients so there is a continuous challenge for new advancements to be made in the present medical therapies. Probiotics are live microorganisms that are intended to have health benefits when consumed or applied to the body. Probiotic bacteria plays a crucial role in maintaining gut microbiota homeostasis, strengthening of gut barrier function and host immune responses. Thus, in order to combat chronic inflammation during UC and to improve quality of life in patients, probiotic supplementation is emerging as a therapeutic option of great interest.

  {"id":"dingEvaluatingMoleculebasedPrediction2016","abstract":"Motivation: Molecule-based prediction of drug response is one major task of precision oncology. Recently, large-scale cancer genomic studies, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), provide the opportunity to evaluate the predictive utility of molecular data for clinical drug responses in multiple cancer types.Results: Here, we first curated the drug treatment information from TCGA. Four chemotherapeutic drugs had more than 180 clinical response records. Then, we developed a computational framework to evaluate the molecule based predictions of clinical responses of the four drugs and to identify the corresponding molecular signatures. Results show that mRNA or miRNA expressions can predict drug responses significantly better than random classifiers in specific cancer types. A few signature genes are involved in drug response related pathways, such as DDB1 in DNA repair pathway and DLL4 in Notch signaling pathway. Finally, we applied the framework to predict responses across multiple cancer types and found that the prediction performances get improved for cisplatin based on miRNA expressions. Integrative analysis of clinical drug response data and molecular data offers opportunities for discovering predictive markers in cancer.

  {"id":"erringtonChallengesAssessingReplicability2021","abstract":"We conducted the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology to investigate the replicability of preclinical research in cancer biology. The initial aim of the project was to repeat 193 experiments from 53 high-impact papers, using an approach in which the experimental protocols and plans for data analysis had to be peer reviewed and accepted for publication before experimental work could begin. However, the various barriers and challenges we encountered while designing and conducting the experiments meant that we were only able to repeat 50 experiments from 23 papers. Here we report these barriers and challenges. First, many original papers failed to report key descriptive and inferential statistics: the data needed to compute effect sizes and conduct power analyses was publicly accessible for just 4 of 193 experiments. Moreover, despite contacting the authors of the original papers, we were unable to obtain these data for 68% of the experiments. Second, none of the 193 experiments were described in sufficient detail in the original paper to enable us to design protocols to repeat the experiments, so we had to seek clarifications from the original authors. While authors were extremely or very helpful for 41% of experiments, they were minimally helpful for 9% of experiments, and not at all helpful (or did not respond to us) for 32% of experiments. Third, once experimental work started, 67% of the peer-reviewed protocols required modifications to complete the research and just 41% of those modifications could be implemented. Cumulatively, these three factors limited the number of experiments that could be repeated. This experience draws attention to a basic and fundamental concern about replication – it is hard to assess whether reported findings are credible.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Errington","given":"Timothy M"},{"family":"Denis","given":"Alexandria"},{"family":"Perfito","given":"Nicole"},{"family":"Iorns","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Nosek","given":"Brian A"}],"citation-key":"erringtonChallengesAssessingReplicability2021","container-title":"eLife","DOI":"10.7554/eLife.67995","editor":[{"family":"Rodgers","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Franco","given":"Eduardo"}],"ISSN":"2050-084X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"page":"e67995","publisher":"eLife Sciences Publications, Ltd","source":"eLife","title":"Challenges for assessing replicability in preclinical cancer biology","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.67995","volume":"10"},

I use the discrepancy between the expected Michaelis-Menten process of enzyme kinetics and the widely observed Hill equation pattern of biological systems to explore the general properties of biological input-output relations. I start with the various processes that could explain the discrepancy between basic chemistry and biological pattern. I then expand the analysis to consider broader aspects that shape biological input-output relations. Key aspects include the input-output processing by component subsystems and how those components combine to determine the system’s overall input-output relations. That aggregate structure often imposes strong regularity on underlying disorder. Aggregation imposes order by dissipating information as it flows through the components of a system. The dissipation of information may be evaluated by the analysis of measurement and precision, explaining why certain common scaling patterns arise so frequently in input-output relations. I discuss how aggregation, measurement and scale provide a framework for understanding the relations between pattern and process. The regularity imposed by those broader structural aspects sets the contours of variation in biology. Thus, biological design will also tend to follow those contours.

Recently, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as an alternative for precise readouts of the transcriptome. To date, no study has compared the ability of the two technologies to quantify clinically relevant individual genes and microarray-derived gene expression signatures (GES) in a set of BC samples encompassing the known molecular BC’s subtypes. To accomplish this, the RNA from 57 BCs representing the four main molecular subtypes (triple negative, HER2 positive, luminal A, luminal B), was profiled with Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The correlations of three clinically relevant BC genes, six molecular subtype classifiers, and a selection of 21 GES were evaluated.\n\nResults\n16,097 genes common to the two platforms were retained for downstream analysis. Gene-wise comparison of microarray and RNA-Seq data revealed that 52% had a Spearman’s correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 with highly correlated genes displaying significantly higher expression levels. We found excellent correlation between microarray and RNA-Seq for the estrogen receptor (ER; rs = 0.973; 95% CI: 0.971-0.975), progesterone receptor (PgR; rs = 0.95; 0.947-0.954), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; rs = 0.918; 0.912-0.923), while a few discordances between ER and PgR quantified by immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq/microarray were observed. All the subtype classifiers evaluated agreed well (Cohen’s kappa coefficients >0.8) and all the proliferation-based GES showed excellent Spearman correlations between microarray and RNA-Seq (all rs >0.965). Immune-, stroma- and pathway-based GES showed a lower correlation relative to prognostic signatures (all rs >0.6).\n\nConclusions\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study to report a systematic comparison of RNA-Seq to microarray for the evaluation of single genes and GES clinically relevant to BC.

  {"id":"gadagkarComputationalToolsFitting2015","abstract":"Abstract Introduction  Many biological response curves commonly assume a sigmoidal shape that can be approximated well by means of the 4-parameter nonlinear logistic equation, also called the Hill equation. However, estimation of the Hill equation parameters requires access to commercial software or the ability to write computer code. Here we present two user-friendly and freely available computer programs to fit the Hill equation — a Solver-based Microsoft Excel template and a stand-alone GUI-based “point and click” program, called HEPB. Methods  Both computer programs use the iterative method to estimate two of the Hill equation parameters (EC 50 and the Hill slope), while constraining the values of the other two parameters (the minimum and maximum asymptotes of the response variable) to fit the Hill equation to the data. In addition, HEPB draws the prediction band at a user-defined confidence level, and determines the EC 50 value for each of the limits of this band to give boundary values that help objectively delineate sensitive, normal and resistant responses to the drug being tested. Results  Both programs were tested by analyzing twelve datasets that varied widely in data values, sample size and slope, and were found to yield estimates of the Hill equation parameters that were essentially identical to those provided by commercial software such as GraphPad Prism and nls, the statistical package in the programming language R. Discussion  The Excel template provides a means to estimate the parameters of the Hill equation and plot the regression line in a familiar Microsoft Office environment. HEPB, in addition to providing the above results, also computes the prediction band for the data at a user-defined level of confidence, and determines objective cut-off values to distinguish among response types (sensitive, normal and resistant). Both programs are found to yield estimated values that are essentially the same as those from standard software such as GraphPad Prism and the R-based nls. Furthermore, HEPB also has the option to simulate 500 response values based on the range of values of the dose variable in the original data and the fit of the Hill equation to that data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Gadagkar","given":"Sudhindra R."},{"family":"Call","given":"Gerald B."}],"citation-key":"gadagkarComputationalToolsFitting2015","container-title":"Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods","container-title-short":"Journal of Pharmacological and Toxicological Methods","DOI":"10.1016/j.vascn.2014.08.006","ISSN":"10568719","issue":"Complete","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"page":"68-76","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"Scholars Portal Journals","title":"Computational tools for fitting the Hill equation to dose–response curves","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://journals.scholarsportal.info/details/10568719/v71icomplete/68_ctffthetdc.xml","volume":"71"},
  {"id":"gaoSelectiveInferenceHierarchical2021","abstract":"Classical tests for a difference in means control the type I error rate when the groups are defined a priori. However, when the groups are instead defined via clustering, then applying a classical test yields an extremely inflated type I error rate. Notably, this problem persists even if two separate and independent data sets are used to define the groups and to test for a difference in their means. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a selective inference approach to test for a difference in means between two clusters. Our procedure controls the selective type I error rate by accounting for the fact that the choice of null hypothesis was made based on the data. We describe how to efficiently compute exact p-values for clusters obtained using agglomerative hierarchical clustering with many commonly-used linkages. We apply our method to simulated data and to single-cell RNA-sequencing data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gao","given":"Lucy L."},{"family":"Bien","given":"Jacob"},{"family":"Witten","given":"Daniela"}],"citation-key":"gaoSelectiveInferenceHierarchical2021","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2012.02936","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,22]]},"number":"arXiv:2012.02936","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Selective Inference for Hierarchical Clustering","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02936"},

In addition, the Hill equation was the first (and is the simplest) quantitative receptor model in pharmacology. Although the Hill equation is an empirical receptor model (its parameters have only physico-chemical meaning for a simple ligand binding reaction), it requires only minor a priori knowledge about the mechanism of action for the investigated agonist to reliably fit concentration-response curve data and to yield useful results (in contrast to most of the advanced receptor models). Thus, the Hill equation has remained an important tool for physiological and pharmacological investigations including drug discovery, moreover it serves as a theoretical basis for the development of new pharmacological models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Gesztelyi","given":"Rudolf"},{"family":"Zsuga","given":"Judit"},{"family":"Kemeny-Beke","given":"Adam"},{"family":"Varga","given":"Balazs"},{"family":"Juhasz","given":"Bela"},{"family":"Tosaki","given":"Arpad"}],"citation-key":"gesztelyiHillEquationOrigin2012","container-title":"Archive for History of Exact Sciences","container-title-short":"Arch.

Rearrangement of the MLL1 gene is associated with onset and progression of acute myeloid and lymphoblastic leukemias, and targeting the WDR5-MLL1 interaction may result in new cancer therapeutics. Our previous work showed that binding of small molecule ligands to WDR5 can modulate its interaction with MLL1, suppressing MLL1 methyltransferase activity. Initial structure–activity relationship studies identified N-(2-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-5-substituted-phenyl) benzamides as potent and selective antagonists of this protein–protein interaction. Guided by crystal structure data and supported by in silico library design, we optimized the scaffold by varying the C-1 benzamide and C-5 substituents. This allowed us to develop the first highly potent (Kdisp < 100 nM) small molecule antagonists of the WDR5-MLL1 interaction and demonstrate that N-(4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-3′-(morpholinomethyl)-[1,1′-biphenyl]-3-yl)-6-oxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-1,6-dihydropyridine-3-carboxamide 16d (OICR-9429) is a potent and selective chemical probe suitable to help dissect the biological role of WDR5.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Getlik","given":"Matthäus"},{"family":"Smil","given":"David"},{"family":"Zepeda-Velázquez","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Bolshan","given":"Yuri"},{"family":"Poda","given":"Gennady"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Aiping"},{"family":"Kuznetsova","given":"Ekaterina"},{"family":"Marcellus","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Senisterra","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Dombrovski","given":"Ludmila"},{"family":"Hajian","given":"Taraneh"},{"family":"Kiyota","given":"Taira"},{"family":"Schapira","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Arrowsmith","given":"Cheryl H."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Vedadi","given":"Masoud"},{"family":"Al-awar","given":"Rima"}],"citation-key":"getlikStructureBasedOptimizationSmall2016","container-title":"Journal of Medicinal Chemistry","container-title-short":"J.

Selective expression of a short 30 kDa C/EBPα translational isoform, termed p30, represents the most common type of CEBPA mutations in AML. The molecular mechanisms underlying p30-mediated transformation remain incompletely understood. We show that C/EBPα p30, but not the normal p42 isoform, preferentially interacts with Wdr5, a key component of SET/MLL histone-methyltransferase complexes. Accordingly, p30-bound genomic regions were enriched for MLL-dependent H3K4me3 marks. The p30-dependent increase in self-renewal and inhibition of myeloid differentiation required Wdr5, as its down-regulation inhibited proliferation and restored differentiation in p30-dependent AML models. OICR-9429 is a novel small-molecule antagonist of the Wdr5-MLL interaction. This compound selectively inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation in p30-expressing human AML cells. Our data reveal the mechanism of p30-dependent transformation and establish the essential p30-cofactor Wdr5 as a therapeutic target in CEBPA-mutant AML.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Grebien","given":"Florian"},{"family":"Vedadi","given":"Masoud"},{"family":"Getlik","given":"Matthäus"},{"family":"Giambruno","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Grover","given":"Amit"},{"family":"Avellino","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Skucha","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Vittori","given":"Sarah"},{"family":"Kuznetsova","given":"Ekaterina"},{"family":"Smil","given":"David"},{"family":"Barsyte-Lovejoy","given":"Dalia"},{"family":"Li","given":"Fengling"},{"family":"Poda","given":"Gennadiy"},{"family":"Schapira","given":"Matthieu"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Aiping"},{"family":"Senisterra","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"Stukalov","given":"Alexey"},{"family":"Huber","given":"Kilian V.

  {"id":"guoClinicallyRelevantMolecular2015","abstract":"Purpose: Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm with smooth muscle differentiation. Little is known about its molecular heterogeneity and no targeted therapy currently exists for leiomyosarcoma. Recognition of different molecular subtypes is necessary to evaluate novel therapeutic options. In a previous study on 51 leiomyosarcomas, we identified three molecular subtypes in leiomyosarcoma. The current study was performed to determine whether the existence of these subtypes could be confirmed in independent cohorts.\nExperimental Design: Ninety-nine cases of leiomyosarcoma were expression profiled with 3′end RNA-Sequencing (3SEQ). Consensus clustering was conducted to determine the optimal number of subtypes.\nResults: We identified 3 leiomyosarcoma molecular subtypes and confirmed this finding by analyzing publically available data on 82 leiomyosarcoma from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We identified two new formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue-compatible diagnostic immunohistochemical markers; LMOD1 for subtype I leiomyosarcoma and ARL4C for subtype II leiomyosarcoma. A leiomyosarcoma tissue microarray with known clinical outcome was used to show that subtype I leiomyosarcoma is associated with good outcome in extrauterine leiomyosarcoma while subtype II leiomyosarcoma is associated with poor prognosis in both uterine and extrauterine leiomyosarcoma. The leiomyosarcoma subtypes showed significant differences in expression levels for genes for which novel targeted therapies are being developed, suggesting that leiomyosarcoma subtypes may respond differentially to these targeted therapies.\nConclusions: We confirm the existence of 3 molecular subtypes in leiomyosarcoma using two independent datasets and show that the different molecular subtypes are associated with distinct clinical outcomes. The findings offer an opportunity for treating leiomyosarcoma in a subtype-specific targeted approach.

Here, we present the largest comparative study between microarray and RNAseq methods to date using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data. We found high correlations between expression data obtained from the Affymetrix one-channel microarray and RNAseq (Spearman correlations coefficients of ∼0.8). We also observed that the low abundance genes had poorer correlations between microarray and RNAseq data than high abundance genes. As expected, due to measurement and normalization differences, Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data were poorly correlated (Spearman correlations coefficients of only ∼0.2). By examining the differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal samples we observed reasonable concordance in directionality between Agilent two-channel microarray and RNAseq data, although a small group of genes were found to have expression changes reported in opposite directions using these two technologies. Overall, RNAseq produces comparable results to microarray technologies in term of expression profiling. The RNAseq normalization methods RPKM and RSEM produce similar results on the gene level and reasonably concordant results on the exon level.

As a consequence, in most applications the resulting clustering scheme requires\nsome sort of evaluation of its validity. Evaluating the results of a clustering algorithm is\nknown as “cluster validation.” The present chapter focuses on relative cluster validity criteria that are used to compare different clusterings and find the one that “best” fits the\nconsidered data. These criteria are implemented by validity indices that can be evaluatedoffrom the data set and the given clustering alone without having access to a “true” clustering. This chapter aims at presenting an overview of the available relative cluster validity\nindices and at highlighting the differences between them and their implicit assumptions.\nFurthermore, we mention some software packages, we stress the requirements that are\nunder-addressed by the recent approaches, and address new research directions.","author":[{"family":"Halkidi","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Vazirgiannis","given":"Michalis"},{"family":"Hennig","given":"Christian"}],"citation-key":"halkidiMethodIndependentIndicesCluster2015","container-title":"Handbook of Cluster Analysis","ISBN":"978-0-429-18547-2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015]]},"number-of-pages":"24","publisher":"Chapman and Hall/CRC","title":"Method-Independent Indices for Cluster Validation and Estimating the Number of Clusters","type":"chapter"},
  {"id":"halkidiQualitySchemeAssessment2000","abstract":"Clustering is mostly an unsupervised procedure and most of the clustering algorithms depend on assumptions and initial guesses in order to define the subgroups presented in a data set. As a consequence, in most applications the final clusters require some sort of evaluation. The evaluation procedure has to tackle difficult problems, which can be qualitatively expressed as: i. quality of clusters, ii. the degree with which a clustering scheme fits a specific data set, iii. the optimal number of clusters in a partitioning. In this paper we present a scheme for finding the optimal partitioning of a data set during the clustering process regardless of the clustering algorithm used. More specifically, we present an approach for evaluation of clustering schemes (partitions) so as to find the best number of clusters, which occurs in a specific data set. A clustering algorithm produces different partitions for different values of the input parameters. The proposed approach selects the best clustering scheme (i.e., the scheme with the most compact and well-separated clusters), according to a quality index we define. We verified our approach using two popular clustering algorithms on synthetic and real data sets in order to evaluate its reliability. Moreover, we study the influence of different clustering parameters to the proposed quality index.","author":[{"family":"Halkidi","given":"M."},{"family":"Vazirgiannis","given":"M."},{"family":"Batistakis","given":"Y."}],"citation-key":"halkidiQualitySchemeAssessment2000","collection-title":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science","container-title":"Principles of Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery","DOI":"10.1007/3-540-45372-5_26","editor":[{"family":"Zighed","given":"Djamel A."},{"family":"Komorowski","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Żytkow","given":"Jan"}],"event-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","ISBN":"978-3-540-45372-7","issued":{"date-parts":[[2000]]},"language":"en","page":"265-276","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"Springer Link","title":"Quality Scheme Assessment in the Clustering Process","type":"paper-conference"},

Epigenetic alterations influence multiple aspects of cancer, however epigenetic profiling of LMS has been limited. The goal of this study was to delineate the molecular landscape of LMS for subtype-specific differences (uterine LMS (ULMS) vs soft tissue LMS (STLMS)) based on integrated analysis of DNA methylation and gene expression to identify potential targets for therapeutic intervention and diagnosis. We identified differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes associated with ULMS and STLMS using DNA methylation and RNA-seq data from primary tumors. Two main clusters were identified through unsupervised hierarchical clustering: ULMS-enriched cluster and STLMS-enriched cluster. The integrated analysis demonstrated 34 genes associated with hypermethylation of the promoter CpG islands and downregulation of gene expression in ULMS or STLMS. In summary, these results indicate that differential DNA methylation and gene expression patterns are associated with ULMS and STLMS. Further studies are needed to delineate the contribution of epigenetic regulation to LMS subtype-specific gene expression and determine the roles of the differentially methylated and differentially expressed genes as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Hasan","given":"Nesrin M."},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Anup"},{"family":"Ruzgar","given":"Nensi M."},{"family":"Deshpande","given":"Hari"},{"family":"Olino","given":"Kelly"},{"family":"Khan","given":"Sajid"},{"family":"Ahuja","given":"Nita"}],"citation-key":"hasanEpigeneticSignaturesDifferentiate2021","container-title":"Oncotarget","container-title-short":"Oncotarget","DOI":"10.18632/oncotarget.28032","ISSN":"1949-2553","issue":"16","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,3]]},"page":"1566-1579","PMCID":"PMC8351604","PMID":"34381562","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Epigenetic signatures differentiate uterine and soft tissue leiomyosarcoma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8351604/","volume":"12"},

Because of the inherent heterogeneity of tumors, these small molecules are often administered in combination to prevent emergence of resistant cell subpopulations. Therefore, new combination strategies to overcome drug resistance in patients with advanced cancer are needed. In this study, we performed a systematic evaluation of the therapeutic activity of over 5,000 pairs of FDA-approved cancer drugs against a panel of 60 well-characterized human tumor cell lines (NCI-60) to uncover combinations with greater than additive growth-inhibitory activity. Screening results were compiled into a database, termed the NCI-ALMANAC (A Large Matrix of Anti-Neoplastic Agent Combinations), publicly available at https://dtp.cancer.gov/ncialmanac. Subsequent in vivo experiments in mouse xenograft models of human cancer confirmed combinations with greater than single-agent efficacy. Concomitant detection of mechanistic biomarkers for these combinations in vivo supported the initiation of two phase I clinical trials at the NCI to evaluate clofarabine with bortezomib and nilotinib with paclitaxel in patients with advanced cancer. Consequently, the hypothesis-generating NCI-ALMANAC web-based resource has demonstrated value in identifying promising combinations of approved drugs with potent anticancer activity for further mechanistic study and translation to clinical trials.

Since then, the international collaboration has worked to convert this draft into a genome sequence with high accuracy and nearly complete coverage. Here, we report the result of this finishing process. The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers ∼99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of ∼1 event per 100,000 bases. Many of the remaining euchromatic gaps are associated with segmental duplications and will require focused work with new methods. The near-complete sequence, the first for a vertebrate, greatly improves the precision of biological analyses of the human genome including studies of gene number, birth and death.

The number of possible drug combinations vastly exceeds what could be tested clinically. Efforts to systematically identify active combinations and the tissues and molecular contexts in which they are most effective could accelerate the development of combination treatments. Here we evaluate the potency and efficacy of 2,025 clinically relevant two-drug combinations, generating a dataset encompassing 125 molecularly characterized breast, colorectal and pancreatic cancer cell lines. We show that synergy between drugs is rare and highly context-dependent, and that combinations of targeted agents are most likely to be synergistic. We incorporate multi-omic molecular features to identify combination biomarkers and specify synergistic drug combinations and their active contexts, including in basal-like breast cancer, and microsatellite-stable or KRAS-mutant colon cancer. Our results show that irinotecan and CHEK1 inhibition have synergistic effects in microsatellite-stable or KRAS–TP53 double-mutant colon cancer cells, leading to apoptosis and suppression of tumour xenograft growth.

  {"id":"jensenItTimeStart2020","abstract":"Cell culture is an important and necessary process in drug discovery, cancer research, as well as stem cell study. Most cells are currently cultured using two-dimensional (2D) methods but new and improved methods that implement three-dimensional (3D) cell culturing techniques suggest compelling evidence that much more advanced experiments can be performed yielding valuable insights. When performing 3D cell culture experiments, the cell environment can be manipulated to mimic that of a cell in vivo and provide more accurate data about cell-to-cell interactions, tumor characteristics, drug discovery, metabolic profiling, stem cell research, and other types of diseases. Scaffold based techniques such as hydrogel-based support, polymeric hard material-based support, hydrophilic glass fiber, and organoids are employed, and each provide their own advantages and applications. Likewise, there are also scaffold free techniques used such as hanging drop microplates, magnetic levitation, and spheroid microplates with ultra-low attachment coating. 3D cell culture has the potential to provide alternative ways to study organ behavior via the use of organoids and is expected to eventually bridge the gap between 2D cell culture and animal models. The present review compares 2D cell culture to 3D cell culture, provides the details surrounding the different 3D culture techniques, as well as focuses on the present and future applications of 3D cell culture.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Jensen","given":"Caleb"},{"family":"Teng","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"jensenItTimeStart2020","container-title":"Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences","DOI":"10.3389/fmolb.2020.00033","ISSN":"2296-889X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020]]},"page":"33","source":"Frontiers","title":"Is It Time to Start Transitioning From 2D to 3D Cell Culture?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmolb.2020.00033","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"jungUtilizationOncoscanMicroarray2017","abstract":"Current strategies for cancer patient management include the use of genomic and proteomic test results to help guide therapeutic selection. The need for multi-target variant analysis is highlighted by the growing number of novel therapies to treat tumors with specific profiles and the increasing recognition that cancer is an extremely heterogeneous syndrome. Microarray analysis is a powerful genomic tool that provides genome-wide genetic information that is critical for guiding cancer treatments. Unlike constitutional applications of microarray analysis which are performed on whole blood samples, microarray analysis of solid tumors is challenging because tumor tissues are typically formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE). Genomic DNA extracted from FFPE tissues can also be fragmented into small pieces and yield much lower concentrations of DNA. We validated and implemented the Affymetrix OncoScan® FFPE assay to enable genome-wide analysis from these types of samples. The Affymetrix OncoScan® assay utilizes molecular inversion probes that generate multiplexed array hybridization targets from as short as 40 base-pairs of sequence and as low as approximately 80 ng of genomic DNA. OncoScan microarray analysis provides genomic information that includes structural variations, copy number variations and SNPs in a timely and a cost-effective manner from FFPE tumor tissues.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Jung","given":"Hou-Sung"},{"family":"Lefferts","given":"Joel A."},{"family":"Tsongalis","given":"Gregory J."}],"citation-key":"jungUtilizationOncoscanMicroarray2017","container-title":"Applied Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Applied Cancer Research","DOI":"10.1186/s41241-016-0007-3","ISSN":"1980-5578","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,1,10]]},"page":"1","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Utilization of the oncoscan microarray assay in cancer diagnostics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s41241-016-0007-3","volume":"37"},

Both innate and adaptive immune cells play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of UC. In the case of innate immune response cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages have a crucial impact on the development of the disease, as well as innate lymphoid cells, which have received a particular attention in recent years. On the other hand, mechanisms of the adaptive immune response involve cells such as: cytotoxic lymphocytes, regulatory lymphocytes Treg, or helper lymphocytes Th–Th2, Th9, Th17, Th22, among which significant discoveries about Th9 and Th17 lymphocytes have been made in recent years. Due to the presence of antibodies directed against resident microbiota or one’s own tissues, the influence of B lymphocytes on the development of UC is also highlighted. Additionally, the impact of cytokines on shaping the immune response as well as sustaining inflammation seems to be crucial. This review briefly describes the current state of knowledge about the involvement of the innate and adaptive immune systems in the pathogenesis of UC. The review is based on personal selection of literature that were retrieved by a selective search in PubMed using the terms “ulcerative colitis” and “pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis”. It included systematic reviews, meta-analyses and clinical trials. Our knowledge of the involvement of the immune system in the pathophysiology of IBD has advanced rapidly over the last two decades, leading to the development of several immune-targeted treatments with a biological source, known as biologic agents.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Kałużna","given":"Aleksandra"},{"family":"Olczyk","given":"Paweł"},{"family":"Komosińska-Vassev","given":"Katarzyna"}],"citation-key":"kaluznaRoleInnateAdaptive2022","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Medicine","DOI":"10.3390/jcm11020400","ISSN":"2077-0383","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1]]},"language":"en","number":"2","page":"400","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Role of Innate and Adaptive Immune Cells in the Pathogenesis and Development of the Inflammatory Response in Ulcerative Colitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/11/2/400","volume":"11"},

Dye exclusion assays include trypan blue, eosin, congo red, and erythrosine B stain assays, whereas 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT), 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium (MTS), 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT), 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-1), 2-(2-methoxy-4-nitrophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, monosodium salt (WST-8), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), sulforhodamine B (SRB), neutral red uptake (NRU), and crystal violet stain (CVS) assays are among the colorimetric assays. Similarly, resazurin and 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate acetoxymethyl ester (5-CFDA-AM) assays are based on fluorometric measurements, whereas luminometric assays comprise adenosine triphosphate and real-time viability assays. Major flow cytometric assays include membrane asymmetry, membrane permeability, and mitochondria assays. In this guideline, the mechanisms and the practice of assessment of the most common cell viability assays applied in research labs are discussed in detail. An ideal cell viability assay should be safe, rapid, reliable, efficient, and time- and cost-effective, and should not interfere with the test compound.

  {"id":"karimDeepLearningbasedClustering2021","abstract":"Clustering is central to many data-driven bioinformatics research and serves a powerful computational method. In particular, clustering helps at analyzing unstructured and high-dimensional data in the form of sequences, expressions, texts and images. Further, clustering is used to gain insights into biological processes in the genomics level, e.g. clustering of gene expressions provides insights on the natural structure inherent in the data, understanding gene functions, cellular processes, subtypes of cells and understanding gene regulations. Subsequently, clustering approaches, including hierarchical, centroid-based, distribution-based, density-based and self-organizing maps, have long been studied and used in classical machine learning settings. In contrast, deep learning (DL)-based representation and feature learning for clustering have not been reviewed and employed extensively. Since the quality of clustering is not only dependent on the distribution of data points but also on the learned representation, deep neural networks can be effective means to transform mappings from a high-dimensional data space into a lower-dimensional feature space, leading to improved clustering results. In this paper, we review state-of-the-art DL-based approaches for cluster analysis that are based on representation learning, which we hope to be useful, particularly for bioinformatics research. Further, we explore in detail the training procedures of DL-based clustering algorithms, point out different clustering quality metrics and evaluate several DL-based approaches on three bioinformatics use cases, including bioimaging, cancer genomics and biomedical text mining. We believe this review and the evaluation results will provide valuable insights and serve a starting point for researchers wanting to apply DL-based unsupervised methods to solve emerging bioinformatics research problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Karim","given":"Md Rezaul"},{"family":"Beyan","given":"Oya"},{"family":"Zappa","given":"Achille"},{"family":"Costa","given":"Ivan G"},{"family":"Rebholz-Schuhmann","given":"Dietrich"},{"family":"Cochez","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Decker","given":"Stefan"}],"citation-key":"karimDeepLearningbasedClustering2021","container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bbz170","ISSN":"1477-4054","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,1]]},"page":"393-415","source":"Silverchair","title":"Deep learning-based clustering approaches for bioinformatics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbz170","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"kaurUlcerativeColitisUnderstanding2020","abstract":"Dynamic interactions between the gastrointestinal epithelium and the mucosal immune system normally contribute to ensuring intestinal homeostasis and optimal immunosurveillance, but destabilisation of these interactions in genetically predisposed individuals can lead to the development of chronic inflammatory diseases. Ulcerative colitis is one of the main types of inflammatory diseases that affect the bowel, but its pathogenesis has yet to be completely defined. Several genetic factors and other inflammation-related genes are implicated in mediating the inflammation and development of the disease. Some susceptibility loci associated with increased risk of ulcerative colitis are found to be implicated in mucosal barrier function. Different biomarkers that cause damage to the colonic mucosa can be detected in patients, including perinuclear ANCA, which is also useful in distinguishing ulcerative colitis from other colitides. The choice of treatment for ulcerative colitis depends on disease severity. Therapeutic strategies include anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) monoclonal antibodies used to block the production of TNF-α that mediates intestinal tract inflammation, an anti-adhesion drug that prevents lymphocyte infiltration from the blood into the inflamed gut, inhibitors of JAK1 and JAK3 that suppress the innate immune cell signalling and interferons α/β which stimulate the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, as well as faecal microbiota transplantation. Although further research is still required to fully dissect the pathophysiology of ulcerative colitis, understanding its cellular pathology and molecular mechanisms has already proven beneficial and it has got the potential to identify further novel, effective targets for therapy and reduce the burden of this chronic disease.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Kaur","given":"Amandip"},{"family":"Goggolidou","given":"Paraskevi"}],"citation-key":"kaurUlcerativeColitisUnderstanding2020","container-title":"Journal of Inflammation","container-title-short":"Journal of Inflammation","DOI":"10.1186/s12950-020-00246-4","ISSN":"1476-9255","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,4,21]]},"page":"15","source":"BioMed Central","title":"Ulcerative colitis: understanding its cellular pathology could provide insights into novel therapies","title-short":"Ulcerative colitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12950-020-00246-4","volume":"17"},

Computational methods enable systematic in-silico screening of combination effects, and can thereby prioritize most potent combinations for further testing, among the massive number of potential combinations. To help researchers to choose a prediction method that best fits for various real-world applications, we carried out a systematic literature review of 117 computational methods developed to date for drug combination prediction, and classified the methods in terms of their combination prediction tasks and input data requirements. Most current methods focus on prediction or classification of combination synergy, and only a few methods consider the efficacy and potential toxicity of the combinations, which are the key determinants of therapeutic success of drug treatments. Furthermore, there is a need to further develop methods that enable dose-specific predictions of combination effects across multiple doses, which is important for clinical translation of the predictions, as well as model-based identification of biomarkers predictive of heterogeneous drug combination responses.

To further our knowledge on drug sensitivity, machine learning techniques are commonly applied to cancer cell line panels.We present a novel integer linear programming formulation, called MEthod for Rule Identification with multi-omics DAta (MERIDA), for predicting the drug sensitivity of cancer cells. The method represents a modified version of the LOBICO method and yields easily interpretable models amenable to a Boolean logic-based interpretation. Since the proposed altered logical rules lead to an enormous acceleration of the running times of MERIDA compared to LOBICO, we cannot only consider larger input feature sets integrated from genetic and molecular omics data but also build more comprehensive models that mirror the complexity of cancer initiation and progression. Moreover, we enable the inclusion of a priori knowledge that can either stem from biomarker databases or can also be newly acquired knowledge gathered iteratively by previous runs of MERIDA. Our results show that this approach does not only lead to an improved predictive performance but also identifies a variety of putative sensitivity and resistance biomarkers. We also compare our approach to state-of-the-art machine learning methods and demonstrate the superior performance of our method.

  {"id":"madanitonekaboniPredictiveApproachesDrug2018","abstract":"Drug combinations have been proposed as a promising therapeutic strategy to overcome drug resistance and improve efficacy of monotherapy regimens in cancer. This strategy aims at targeting multiple components of this complex disease. Despite the increasing number of drug combinations in use, many of them were empirically found in the clinic, and the molecular mechanisms underlying these drug combinations are often unclear. These challenges call for rational, systematic approaches for drug combination discovery. Although high-throughput screening of single-agent therapeutics has been successfully implemented, it is not feasible to test all possible drug combinations, even for a reduced subset of anticancer drugs. Hence, in vitro and in vivo screening of a large number of drug combinations are not practical. Therefore, devising computational methods to efficiently explore the space of drug combinations and to discover efficacious combinations has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community in the past few years. Nevertheless, in the absence of consensus regarding the computational approaches used to predict efficacious drug combinations, a plethora of methods, techniques and hypotheses have been developed to date, while the research field lacks an elaborate categorization of the existing computational methods and the available data sources. In this manuscript, we review and categorize the state-of-the-art computational approaches for drug combination prediction, and elaborate on the limitations of these methods and the existing challenges.

These organoids are being used increasingly to model brain development and disorders, however, they only partially recapitulate such processes, because of several limitations, including inability to mimic the distinct cortical layers, lack of functional neuronal circuitry as well as non-neural cells and gyrification, and increased cellular stress. Efforts to create improved brain organoid culture systems have led to region-specific organoids, vascularized organoids, glia-containing organoids, assembloids, sliced organoids and polarized organoids. Assembloids are fused region-specific organoids, which attempt to recapitulate inter-regional and inter-cellular interactions as well as neural circuitry development by combining multiple brain regions and/or cell lineages. As a result, assembloids can be used to model subtle functional aberrations that reflect complex neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. Mammalian organisms possess a highly complex neuroendocrine system, the stress system, whose main task is the preservation of systemic homeostasis, when the latter is threatened by adverse forces, the stressors. The main central parts of the stress system are the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the locus caeruleus/norepinephrine-autonomic nervous system nuclei in the brainstem; these centers innervate each other and interact reciprocally as well as with various other CNS structures. Chronic dysregulation of the stress system has been implicated in major pathologies, the so-called chronic non-communicable diseases, including neuropsychiatric, neurodegenerative, cardiometabolic and autoimmune disorders, which lead to significant population morbidity and mortality. We speculate that brain organoids and/or assembloids could be used to model the development, regulation and dysregulation of the stress system and to better understand stress-related disorders. Novel brain organoid technologies, combined with high-throughput single-cell omics and gene editing, could, thus, have major implications for precision medicine.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Makrygianni","given":"Evanthia A."},{"family":"Chrousos","given":"George P."}],"citation-key":"makrygianniBrainOrganoidsNetworking2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Physiology","DOI":"10.3389/fphys.2021.621970","ISSN":"1664-042X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"661","source":"Frontiers","title":"From Brain Organoids to Networking Assembloids: Implications for Neuroendocrinology and Stress Medicine","title-short":"From Brain Organoids to Networking Assembloids","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphys.2021.621970","volume":"12"},

  {"id":"manemAbstract3211Therapeutic2018","abstract":"Purpose: Radiotherapy (RT) is the foundation of curative treatment regimens for many cancer types and is often delivered with drugs to produce synergistic effects. The “precision medicine” paradigm in which genomic biomarkers guide therapeutic decisions has eluded RT. To support preclinical discovery of biomarker-directed RT dose and drug combinations, we built a computational platform for integrating and interrogating radiogenomics data sets.Methods: RadioGx integrates in vitro cancer cell line survival data with multimodal molecular profiles from the NCI-60 and Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) cell line panels. We fit published radiation response data from both clonogenic and high-throughput viability assays to established radiobiologic models of clonogenic survival. We assessed the concordance of radiation response profiles across different survival endpoints (i.e., surviving fraction at 2Gy [SF2] and Area Under the Curve of the radiobiologic model [AUC]). By comparing radiation response with transcriptomic data, we examined indicators of radiosensitivity at the pathway level. We integrated drug response data from Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP v2) using an interface between RadioGx and our previously published pharmacogenomics platform, PharmacoGx. Using the oxygen modification factor in established radiobiologic models, we identified pathways that are enriched under hypoxic conditions.Results: RadioGx includes 600 radiation dose response data, 511 gene expression data sets, and 504 drug dose response data for chemotherapeutic compounds. Goodness-of-fit (given by R2 value) of the linear-quadratic radiobiologic model ranged from 0.927 to 0.99 (median=0.998, n=57) for the clonogenic assay and from 0.043 to 0.99 (median=0.952, n=535) for the viability assay. The concordance between SF2 and AUC using the clonogenic assay and the viability assay was 0.79 (n=12) and 0.82 (n=15), respectively. Among cell lines with survival data from both assays (n=28) across two different studies, the concordance of SF2 and AUC was 0.68 and 0.62, respectively. By interrogating the 504 cell lines that were profiled using the viability assay, we found drugs that behaved similar to RT were enriched in three pharmacologic classes, namely, drugs that impact mitosis, DNA replication, or cytoskeleton. Pathway analysis of radiation response under hypoxia revealed two key DNA repair pathways, namely, DNA double-strand break repair by NHEJ and DNA damage-induced 14-3-3, to be enriched compared to normoxic conditions.Conclusions: Our work is a major step towards analyzing preclinical models of radiation response using in vitro survival and transcriptomic data. RadioGx coupled with PharmacoGx lays the foundation for the identification of synergistic drug-RT combinations, which can further push the boundaries of translational research towards precision radiation medicine.Citation Format: Venkata S.

  {"id":"manemModelingCellularResponse2019","abstract":"Radiotherapy is integral to the care of a majority of patients with cancer. Despite differences in tumor responses to radiation (radioresponse), dose prescriptions are not currently tailored to individual patients. Recent large-scale cancer cell line databases hold the promise of unravelling the complex molecular arrangements underlying cellular response to radiation, which is critical for novel predictive biomarker discovery. Here, we present RadioGx, a computational platform for integrative analyses of radioresponse using radiogenomic databases. We fit the dose–response data within RadioGx to the linear-quadratic model. The imputed survival across a range of dose levels (AUC) was a robust radioresponse indicator that correlated with biological processes known to underpin the cellular response to radiation. Using AUC as a metric for further investigations, we found that radiation sensitivity was significantly associated with disruptive mutations in genes related to nonhomologous end joining. Next, by simulating the effects of different oxygen levels, we identified putative genes that may influence radioresponse specifically under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, using transcriptomic data, we found evidence for tissue-specific determinants of radioresponse, suggesting that tumor type could influence the validity of putative predictive biomarkers of radioresponse. Finally, integrating radioresponse with drug response data, we found that drug classes impacting the cytoskeleton, DNA replication, and mitosis display similar therapeutic effects to ionizing radiation on cancer cell lines. In summary, RadioGx provides a unique computational toolbox for hypothesis generation to advance preclinical research for radiation oncology and precision medicine.The RadioGx computational platform enables integrative analyses of cellular response to radiation with drug responses and genome-wide molecular data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Manem","given":"Venkata SK."},{"family":"Lambie","given":"Meghan"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Ian"},{"family":"Smirnov","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Kofia","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Freeman","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Koritzinsky","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Abazeed","given":"Mohamed E."},{"family":"Haibe-Kains","given":"Benjamin"},{"family":"Bratman","given":"Scott V."}],"citation-key":"manemModelingCellularResponse2019","container-title":"Cancer Research","container-title-short":"Cancer Research","DOI":"10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0179","ISSN":"0008-5472","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,12,13]]},"page":"6227-6237","source":"Silverchair","title":"Modeling Cellular Response in Large-Scale Radiogenomic Databases to Advance Precision Radiotherapy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0179","volume":"79"},

Here we present an approach to uncover the efficacy of drug combinations based on the analysis of mono-drug effects.

The drug atlas represents the relations between drug effects and allows to identify independent processes for which the tumor might be particularly vulnerable when attacked by two drugs. Our approach enables the prediction of combination-therapy which can be linked to tumor-driving mutations. By using this strategy, we can uncover potential effective drug combinations on a pan-cancer scale. Predicted synergies are provided and have been validated in glioblastoma, breast cancer, melanoma and leukemia mouse-models, resulting in therapeutic synergy in 75% of the tested models.

They then test each gene for association with the estimated latent variable. If the same data are used for both of these steps, then standard methods for computing p-values and confidence intervals in the second step will fail to achieve statistical guarantees such as Type 1 error control. Furthermore, approaches such as sample splitting that can be applied to solve similar problems in other settings are not applicable in this context. In this paper, we introduce count splitting, a flexible framework that allows us to carry out valid inference in this setting, for virtually any latent variable estimation technique and inference approach, under a Poisson assumption. We demonstrate the Type 1 error control and power of count splitting in a simulation study, and apply count splitting to a dataset of pluripotent stem cells differentiating to cardiomyocytes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Neufeld","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Lucy L."},{"family":"Popp","given":"Joshua"},{"family":"Battle","given":"Alexis"},{"family":"Witten","given":"Daniela"}],"citation-key":"neufeldInferenceLatentVariable2022","DOI":"10.48550/arXiv.2207.00554","issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,1]]},"number":"arXiv:2207.00554","publisher":"arXiv","source":"arXiv.org","title":"Inference after latent variable estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing data","type":"article","URL":"http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.00554"},

Analysis of a metastatic (n = 3,504) and primary (n = 1,854) pan-cancer cohort reveals that HRD is most frequent in ovarian and breast cancer, followed by pancreatic and prostate cancer. We identify biallelic inactivation of BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C or PALB2 as the most common genetic cause of HRD, with RAD51C and PALB2 inactivation resulting in BRCA2-type HRD. We find that while the specific genetic cause of HRD is cancer type specific, biallelic inactivation is predominantly associated with loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH), with increased contribution of deep deletions in prostate cancer.

In cancer treatment, additive and/or synergistic drug combinations can convert weakly efficacious monotherapies into regimens that produce robust antitumor activity.

However, identification of the various interdependencies is difficult due to the complex molecular circuitry that underlies tumor development and progression. Here, we present a high-throughput platform that allows for an unbiased identification of synergistic and efficacious drug combinations. In a screen of 22,737 experiments of 583 doublet combinations in 39 diverse cancer cell lines using a 4 by 4 dosing regimen, both well-known and novel synergistic and efficacious combinations were identified. Here, we present an example of one such novel combination, a Wee1 inhibitor (AZD1775) and an mTOR inhibitor (ridaforolimus), and demonstrate that the combination potently and synergistically inhibits cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo.

Desensitization with allergen-specific immunotherapy (SIT) has been used for over a century, but the dominant protective mechanism remains unclear. One consistent observation is increased allergen-specific IgG, thought to competitively block allergen binding to IgE. Here we show that the blocking potency of the IgG response to Cat-SIT is heterogeneous. Next, using two potent, pre-selected allergen-blocking monoclonal IgG antibodies against the immunodominant cat allergen Fel d 1, we demonstrate that increasing the IgG/IgE ratio reduces the allergic response in mice and in cat-allergic patients: a single dose of blocking IgG reduces clinical symptoms in response to nasal provocation (ANCOVA, p = 0.0003), with a magnitude observed at day 8 similar to that reported with years of conventional SIT.

  {"id":"ossandonCirculatingTumorDNA2018","abstract":"The importance of circulating free DNA (cfDNA) in cancer clinical research was recognized in 1994 when a mutated RAS gene fragment was detected in a patient’s blood sample. Up to 1% of the total circulating DNA in patients with cancer is circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) that originates from tumor cells. As ctDNA is rapidly cleared from the blood stream and can be obtained by minimally invasive methods, it can be used as a dynamic cancer biomarker for cancer early detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. Despite the potential for clinical use, few ctDNA assays have been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. As tools for clinical and translational research, current ctDNA assays face some challenges, and more research is needed to advance use of these assays. On September 29–30, 2016, the Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis at the National Cancer Institute convened a workshop entitled “Circulating Tumor DNA Assays in Clinical Cancer Research” to garner input from industry experts, academia, and government research and regulatory agencies to understand and promote the translation of ctDNA assays to clinical research, with potential to advance to use in clinical practice. This Commentary presents the topics of the workshop covered in the presentations and points made in the discussions that followed: 1) background on ctDNA, 2) potential clinical utility of ctDNA assays, 3) assay technology, 4) assay clinical and analytical validation, and 5) industry perspectives.

  {"id":"parkerSupervisedRiskPredictor2009","abstract":"Purpose\nTo improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression–based “intrinsic” subtypes luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like.\n\nMethods\nA 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen.\n\nResults\nThe intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for pCR of 97%.\n\nConclusion\nDiagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the continuous risk score will be of value for the management of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk score can also be used to assess the likelihood of efficacy from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Parker","given":"Joel S."},{"family":"Mullins","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Cheang","given":"Maggie C.U."},{"family":"Leung","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Voduc","given":"David"},{"family":"Vickery","given":"Tammi"},{"family":"Davies","given":"Sherri"},{"family":"Fauron","given":"Christiane"},{"family":"He","given":"Xiaping"},{"family":"Hu","given":"Zhiyuan"},{"family":"Quackenbush","given":"John F."},{"family":"Stijleman","given":"Inge J."},{"family":"Palazzo","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Marron","given":"J.S."},{"family":"Nobel","given":"Andrew B."},{"family":"Mardis","given":"Elaine"},{"family":"Nielsen","given":"Torsten O."},{"family":"Ellis","given":"Matthew J."},{"family":"Perou","given":"Charles M."},{"family":"Bernard","given":"Philip S."}],"citation-key":"parkerSupervisedRiskPredictor2009","container-title":"Journal of Clinical Oncology","container-title-short":"J Clin Oncol","DOI":"10.1200/JCO.2008.18.1370","ISSN":"0732-183X","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[[2009,3,10]]},"page":"1160-1167","PMCID":"PMC2667820","PMID":"19204204","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Supervised Risk Predictor of Breast Cancer Based on Intrinsic Subtypes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2667820/","volume":"27"},
  {"id":"parkOverviewPrecisionOncology2020","abstract":"With advancements in biomarkers and momentum in precision medicine, biomarker-guided trials such as basket trials and umbrella trials have been developed under the master protocol framework. A master protocol refers to a single, overarching design developed to evaluate multiple hypotheses with the general goal of improving the efficiency of trial evaluation. One type of master protocol is the basket trial, in which a targeted therapy is evaluated for multiple diseases that share common molecular alterations or risk factors that may help predict whether the patients will respond to the given therapy. Another variant of a master protocol is the umbrella trial, in which multiple targeted therapies are evaluated for a single disease that is stratified into multiple subgroups based on different molecular or other predictive risk factors. Both designs follow the core principle of precision medicine—to tailor intervention strategies based on the patient's risk factor(s) that can help predict whether they will respond to a specific treatment. There have been increasing numbers of basket and umbrella trials, but they are still poorly understood. This article reviews common characteristics of basket and umbrella trials, key trials and recent US Food and Drug Administration approvals for precision oncology, and important considerations for clinical readers when critically evaluating future publications on basket trials and umbrella trials and for researchers when designing these clinical trials.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Park","given":"Jay J.

  {"id":"pengCNVDetectionCirculating2019","abstract":"While methods for detecting SNVs and indels in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) with hybridization capture-based next-generation sequencing (NGS) have been available, copy number variations (CNVs) detection is more challenging. Here, we present a method enabling CNV detection from a 150-gene panel using a very low amount of ctDNA. First, a read depth-based CNV estimation method without a paired blood sample was developed and cfDNA sequencing data from healthy people were used to build a panel of normal (PoN) model. Then, in silico and in vitro simulations were performed to define the limit of detection (LOD) for EGFR, ERBB2, and MET. Compared to the WES results of the 48 samples, the concordance rate for EGFR, ERBB2, and MET CNVs was 78%, 89.6%, and 92.4%, respectively. In another cohort profiled with the 150-gene panel from 5980 lung cancer ctDNA samples, we detected the three genes’ amplification with comparable population frequency with other cohorts. One lung adenocarcinoma patient with MET amplification detected by our method reached partial response to crizotinib. These findings show that our ctDNA CNV detection pipeline can detect CNVs with high specificity and concordance, which enables CNV calling in a non-invasive way for cancer patients when tissues are not available.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Peng","given":"Hao"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Lan"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Zisong"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Jian"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Dadong"},{"family":"Nan","given":"Kejun"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xiaochen"},{"family":"Li","given":"Fugen"},{"family":"Tian","given":"Lei"},{"family":"Dong","given":"Hua"},{"family":"Yao","given":"Yu"}],"citation-key":"pengCNVDetectionCirculating2019","container-title":"Genes","container-title-short":"Genes (Basel)","DOI":"10.3390/genes10110926","ISSN":"2073-4425","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,11,14]]},"number":"11","page":"926","PMCID":"PMC6895974","PMID":"31739500","source":"PubMed Central","title":"CNV Detection from Circulating Tumor DNA in Late Stage Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6895974/","volume":"10"},

MONET discovers modules of similar samples, such that each module is allowed to have a clustering structure for only a subset of the omics. This approach differs from most existent multi-omic clustering algorithms, which assume a common structure across all omics, and from several recent algorithms that model distinct cluster structures. We tested MONET extensively on simulated data, on an image dataset, and on ten multi-omic cancer datasets from TCGA.

We demonstrate MONET's biological and clinical relevance by analyzing its results for Ovarian Serous Cystadenocarcinoma. We also show that MONET is robust to missing data, can cluster genes in multi-omic dataset, and reveal modules of cell types in single-cell multi-omic data.

Here, we assess the impact of scanner choice on computed tomography (CT)-derived radiomic features to predict the association of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma with human papillomavirus (HPV). This experiment was performed on CT image datasets acquired from two different scanner manufacturers. We demonstrate strong scanner dependency by developing a machine learning model to classify HPV status from radiological images. These experiments reveal the effect of scanner manufacturer on the robustness of radiomic features, and the extent of this dependency is reflected in the performance of HPV prediction models. The results of this study highlight the importance of implementing an appropriate approach to reducing the impact of imaging parameters on radiomic features and consequently on the machine learning models, without removing features which are deemed non-robust but may contain learning information.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Reiazi","given":"Reza"},{"family":"Arrowsmith","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Welch","given":"Mattea"},{"family":"Abbas-Aghababazadeh","given":"Farnoosh"},{"family":"Eeles","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Tadic","given":"Tony"},{"family":"Hope","given":"Andrew J."},{"family":"Bratman","given":"Scott V."},{"family":"Haibe-Kains","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"reiaziPredictionHumanPapillomavirus2021","container-title":"Cancers","DOI":"10.3390/cancers13092269","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,1]]},"language":"en","number":"9","page":"2269","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Prediction of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Association of Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC) Using Radiomics: The Impact of the Variation of CT Scanner","title-short":"Prediction of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Association of Oropharyngeal Cancer (OPC) Using Radiomics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6694/13/9/2269","volume":"13"},

High-content phenotypic screens such as Perturb-seq (CRISPR-based screens with single-cell RNA-sequencing readouts) enable massively parallel functional genomic mapping but, to date, have been used at limited scales. Here, we perform genome-scale Perturb-seq targeting all expressed genes with CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) across >2.5 million human cells. We use transcriptional phenotypes to predict the function of poorly characterized genes, uncovering new regulators of ribosome biogenesis (including <i>CCDC86</i>, <i>ZNF236</i>, and <i>SPATA5L1</i>), transcription (<i>C7orf26</i>), and mitochondrial respiration (<i>TMEM242</i>). In addition to assigning gene function, single-cell transcriptional phenotypes allow for in-depth dissection of complex cellular phenomena—from RNA processing to differentiation. We leverage this ability to systematically identify genetic drivers and consequences of aneuploidy and to discover an unanticipated layer of stress-specific regulation of the mitochondrial genome.

  {"id":"romaniThymosinA1Represents2017","abstract":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that compromise its chloride-channel activity. The most common mutation, p.Phe508del, results in the production of a misfolded CFTR protein, which has residual channel activity but is prematurely degraded. Because of the inherent complexity of the pathogenetic mechanisms involved in CF —which include impaired chloride permeability and persistent lung inflammation—a multidrug approach is required for efficacious CF therapy. To date, no individual, drug with pleiotropic beneficial effects for CF is available. Here we report on the ability of thymosin alpha 1 (Tα1)—a naturally occurring polypeptide with an excellent safety profile in the clinic when used as an adjuvant or an immunotherapeutic agent—to rectify the multiple tissue defects in CF mice as well as in cells from subjects with the p.Phe508del mutation. Tα1 displayed two combined properties that favorably opposed CF symptomatology; namely, it reduced inflammation and increased CFTR maturation, stability and activity. By virtue of this two-pronged action, Tα1 offers a strong potential to be an efficacious single molecule-based therapeutic agent in CF.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Romani","given":"Luigina"},{"family":"Oikonomou","given":"Vasilis"},{"family":"Moretti","given":"Silvia"},{"family":"Iannitti","given":"Rossana G."},{"family":"D’Adamo","given":"Maria Cristina"},{"family":"Villella","given":"Valeria R."},{"family":"Pariano","given":"Marilena"},{"family":"Sforna","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Borghi","given":"Monica"},{"family":"Bellet","given":"Marina M."},{"family":"Fallarino","given":"Francesca"},{"family":"Pallotta","given":"Maria Teresa"},{"family":"Servillo","given":"Giuseppe"},{"family":"Ferrari","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Puccetti","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Kroemer","given":"Guido"},{"family":"Pessia","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Maiuri","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Goldstein","given":"Allan L."},{"family":"Garaci","given":"Enrico"}],"citation-key":"romaniThymosinA1Represents2017","container-title":"Nature medicine","container-title-short":"Nat Med","DOI":"10.1038/nm.4305","ISSN":"1078-8956","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,5]]},"page":"590-600","PMCID":"PMC5420451","PMID":"28394330","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Thymosin α1 represents a potential potent single molecule-based therapy for cystic fibrosis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5420451/","volume":"23"},

  {"id":"sammutMultiomicMachineLearning2021","abstract":"Breast cancers are complex ecosystems of malignant cells and tumour microenvironment1. The composition of these tumour ecosystems and interactions within them contribute to cytotoxic therapy response2. Efforts to build response predictors have not incorporated this knowledge. We collected clinical, digital pathology, genomic and transcriptomic profiles of pre-treatment biopsies of breast tumours from 168 patients treated with chemotherapy +/- HER2-targeted therapy prior to surgery. Pathology endpoints (complete response or residual disease) at surgery3 were then correlated with multi-omic features in these diagnostic biopsies. Here we show that response to treatment is modulated by the pre-treated tumour ecosystem, and its multi-omics landscape can be integrated in predictive models using machine learning. The degree of residual disease following therapy is monotonically associated with pre-therapy features, including tumour mutational and copy number landscapes, tumour proliferation, immune infiltration and T-cell dysfunction and exclusion. Combining these features into a multi-omic machine learning model predicted pathological complete response in an external validation cohort (75 patients) with an AUC of 0.87. In conclusion, response to therapy is determined by the baseline characteristics of the totality of the tumour ecosystem captured through data integration and machine learning. This approach could be used to develop predictors for other cancers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Sammut","given":"Stephen-John"},{"family":"Crispin-Ortuzar","given":"Mireia"},{"family":"Chin","given":"Suet-Feung"},{"family":"Provenzano","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Bardwell","given":"Helen A."},{"family":"Ma","given":"Wenxin"},{"family":"Cope","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Dariush","given":"Ali"},{"family":"Dawson","given":"Sarah-Jane"},{"family":"Abraham","given":"Jean E."},{"family":"Dunn","given":"Janet"},{"family":"Hiller","given":"Louise"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Jeremy"},{"family":"Cameron","given":"David A."},{"family":"Bartlett","given":"John M.

  {"id":"sharifi-noghabiDrugSensitivityPrediction2021","abstract":"The goal of precision oncology is to tailor treatment for patients individually using the genomic profile of their tumors. Pharmacogenomics datasets such as cancer cell lines are among the most valuable resources for drug sensitivity prediction, a crucial task of precision oncology. Machine learning methods have been employed to predict drug sensitivity based on the multiple omics data available for large panels of cancer cell lines. However, there are no comprehensive guidelines on how to properly train and validate such machine learning models for drug sensitivity prediction. In this paper, we introduce a set of guidelines for different aspects of training gene expression-based predictors using cell line datasets. These guidelines provide extensive analysis of the generalization of drug sensitivity predictors and challenge many current practices in the community including the choice of training dataset and measure of drug sensitivity. The application of these guidelines in future studies will enable the development of more robust preclinical biomarkers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Sharifi-Noghabi","given":"Hossein"},{"family":"Jahangiri-Tazehkand","given":"Soheil"},{"family":"Smirnov","given":"Petr"},{"family":"Hon","given":"Casey"},{"family":"Mammoliti","given":"Anthony"},{"family":"Nair","given":"Sisira Kadambat"},{"family":"Mer","given":"Arvind Singh"},{"family":"Ester","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Haibe-Kains","given":"Benjamin"}],"citation-key":"sharifi-noghabiDrugSensitivityPrediction2021","container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bbab294","ISSN":"1477-4054","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,1]]},"page":"bbab294","source":"Silverchair","title":"Drug sensitivity prediction from cell line-based pharmacogenomics data: guidelines for developing machine learning models","title-short":"Drug sensitivity prediction from cell line-based pharmacogenomics data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab294","volume":"22"},
  {"id":"shenRelationshipIntestinalMicrobiota2018","abstract":"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is an inflammatory disease that mainly affects the colon and rectum. It is believed that genetic factors, host immune system disorders, intestinal microbiota dysbiosis, and environmental factors contribute to the pathogenesis of UC. However, studies on the role of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis of UC have been inconclusive. Studies have shown that probiotics improve intestinal mucosa barrier function and immune system function and promote secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, thereby inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria in the intestine. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) can reduce bowel permeability and thus the severity of disease by increasing the production of short-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, which help maintain the integrity of the epithelial barrier. FMT can also restore immune dysbiosis by inhibiting Th1 differentiation, activity of T cells, leukocyte adhesion, and production of inflammatory factors. Probiotics and FMT are being increasingly used to treat UC, but their use is controversial because of uncertain efficacy. Here, we briefly review the role of intestinal microbiota in the pathogenesis and treatment of UC.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Shen","given":"Zhao-Hua"},{"family":"Zhu","given":"Chang-Xin"},{"family":"Quan","given":"Yong-Sheng"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Zhen-Yu"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shuai"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Wei-Wei"},{"family":"Tan","given":"Bei"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xiao-Yan"}],"citation-key":"shenRelationshipIntestinalMicrobiota2018","container-title":"World Journal of Gastroenterology","container-title-short":"World J Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.3748/wjg.v24.i1.5","ISSN":"1007-9327","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,7]]},"page":"5-14","PMCID":"PMC5757125","PMID":"29358877","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Relationship between intestinal microbiota and ulcerative colitis: Mechanisms and clinical application of probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation","title-short":"Relationship between intestinal microbiota and ulcerative colitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5757125/","volume":"24"},

  {"id":"singhTherapeuticStrategiesBiomarkers2020","abstract":"Poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is commonly known for its vital role in DNA damage response and repair. However, its enzymatic activity has been linked to a plethora of physiological and pathophysiological transactions ranging from cellular proliferation, survival and death. For instance, malignancies with BRCA1/2 mutations heavily rely on PARP activity for survival. Thus, the use of PARP inhibitors is a well-established intervention in these types of tumors. However, recent studies indicate that the therapeutic potential of attenuating PARP1 activity in recalcitrant tumors, especially where PARP1 is aberrantly overexpressed and hyperactivated, may extend its therapeutic utility in wider cancer types beyond BRCA-deficiency. Here, we discuss treatment strategies to expand the tumor-selective therapeutic application of PARP inhibitors and novel approaches with predictive biomarkers to perturb NAD+ levels and hyperPARylation that inactivate PARP in recalcitrant tumors. We also provide an overview of genetic alterations that transform non-BRCA mutant cancers to a state of “BRCAness” as potential biomarkers for synthetic lethality with PARP inhibitors. Finally, we discuss a paradigm shift for the use of novel PARP inhibitors outside of cancer treatment, where it has the potential to rescue normal cells from severe oxidative damage during ischemia-reperfusion injury induced by surgery and radiotherapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Singh","given":"Naveen"},{"family":"Pay","given":"S.

The concordance index (CI), which quantiﬁes the quality of rankings, is the standard performance measure for model assessment in survival analysis. In contrast, the standard approach to learning the popular proportional hazard (PH) model is based on Cox’s partial likelihood. We devise two bounds on CI–one of which emerges directly from the properties of PH models–and optimize them directly. Our experimental results suggest that all three methods perform about equally well, with our new approach giving slightly better results.

  {"id":"talevichCNVkitGenomeWideCopy2016","abstract":"Germline copy number variants (CNVs) and somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs) are of significant importance in syndromic conditions and cancer. Massively parallel sequencing is increasingly used to infer copy number information from variations in the read depth in sequencing data. However, this approach has limitations in the case of targeted re-sequencing, which leaves gaps in coverage between the regions chosen for enrichment and introduces biases related to the efficiency of target capture and library preparation. We present a method for copy number detection, implemented in the software package CNVkit, that uses both the targeted reads and the nonspecifically captured off-target reads to infer copy number evenly across the genome. This combination achieves both exon-level resolution in targeted regions and sufficient resolution in the larger intronic and intergenic regions to identify copy number changes. In particular, we successfully inferred copy number at equivalent to 100-kilobase resolution genome-wide from a platform targeting as few as 293 genes. After normalizing read counts to a pooled reference, we evaluated and corrected for three sources of bias that explain most of the extraneous variability in the sequencing read depth: GC content, target footprint size and spacing, and repetitive sequences. We compared the performance of CNVkit to copy number changes identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. We packaged the components of CNVkit so that it is straightforward to use and provides visualizations, detailed reporting of significant features, and export options for integration into existing analysis pipelines.

  {"id":"ungaroTreattoTargetUpdateUlcerative2019","abstract":"OBJECTIVES:\nIn 2015, the Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) program proposed shifting the therapeutic focus on ulcerative colitis (UC) toward altering the natural history of the disease course by regularly monitoring objective measurements of disease activity and tailoring treatment accordingly. The therapeutic paradigm shift was well received in the research community and is often cited. However, new evidence on optimal UC treatment targets continues to accumulate since the time of the STRIDE guidelines. This systematic review summarizes the evidence accrued since the STRIDE UC recommendations, discusses the barriers for adoption of treat-to-target approaches in clinical practice in UC, and suggests directions for future research.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe systematically reviewed MEDLINE for studies from the time of the STRIDE systematic review up to March 31, 2018, that assessed the potential treatment targets identified by the STRIDE recommendations.\n\nRESULTS:\nEach potential treatment target literature search returned > 200 articles, which were then reviewed by 2 independent investigators for relevant studies. Selected studies of clinical factors, patient-reported outcomes, endoscopy, histology, imaging, and biomarkers and implications on treatment targets are summarized.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nIt appears that the relative weight given to different therapeutic targets in the development and improvement of UC treatments could be optimized, with an increased emphasis on endoscopic and histological targets over clinical or symptomatic targets. For this evolution to occur, however, new research has to demonstrate that the treat-to-target approach will deliver on the promise of better long-term outcomes compared with current approaches.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Ungaro","given":"Ryan"},{"family":"Colombel","given":"Jean-Frédéric"},{"family":"Lissoos","given":"Trevor"},{"family":"Peyrin-Biroulet","given":"Laurent"}],"citation-key":"ungaroTreattoTargetUpdateUlcerative2019","container-title":"The American Journal of Gastroenterology","container-title-short":"Am J Gastroenterol","DOI":"10.14309/ajg.0000000000000183","ISSN":"0002-9270","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[[2019,6]]},"page":"874-883","PMCID":"PMC6553548","PMID":"30908297","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A Treat-to-Target Update in Ulcerative Colitis: A Systematic Review","title-short":"A Treat-to-Target Update in Ulcerative Colitis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6553548/","volume":"114"},
  {"id":"vanderborghtBIGLBiochemicallyIntuitive2017","abstract":"Clinical efficacy regularly requires the combination of drugs. For an early estimation of the clinical value of (potentially many) combinations of pharmacologic compounds during discovery, the observed combination effect is typically compared to that expected under a null model. Mechanistic accuracy of that null model is not aspired to; to the contrary, combinations that deviate favorably from the model (and thereby disprove its accuracy) are prioritized. Arguably the most popular null model is the Loewe Additivity model, which conceptually maps any assay under study to a (virtual) single-step enzymatic reaction. It is easy-to-interpret and requires no other information than the concentration-response curves of the individual compounds. However, the original Loewe model cannot accommodate concentration-response curves with different maximal responses and, by consequence, combinations of an agonist with a partial or inverse agonist. We propose an extension, named Biochemically Intuitive Generalized Loewe (BIGL), that can address different maximal responses, while preserving the biochemical underpinning and interpretability of the original Loewe model. In addition, we formulate statistical tests for detecting synergy and antagonism, which allow for detecting statistically significant greater/lesser observed combined effects than expected from the null model. Finally, we demonstrate the novel method through application to several publicly available datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Van der Borght","given":"Koen"},{"family":"Tourny","given":"Annelies"},{"family":"Bagdziunas","given":"Rytis"},{"family":"Thas","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Nazarov","given":"Maxim"},{"family":"Turner","given":"Heather"},{"family":"Verbist","given":"Bie"},{"family":"Ceulemans","given":"Hugo"}],"citation-key":"vanderborghtBIGLBiochemicallyIntuitive2017","container-title":"Scientific Reports","container-title-short":"Sci Rep","DOI":"10.1038/s41598-017-18068-5","ISSN":"2045-2322","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[[2017,12,20]]},"language":"en","number":"1","page":"17935","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","source":"www.nature.com","title":"BIGL: Biochemically Intuitive Generalized Loewe null model for prediction of the expected combined effect compatible with partial agonism and antagonism","title-short":"BIGL","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18068-5","volume":"7"},
  {"id":"vanlooAllelespecificCopyNumber2010","abstract":"We present an allele-specific copy number analysis of the in vivo breast cancer genome. We describe a unique bioinformatics approach, ASCAT (allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors), to accurately dissect the allele-specific copy number of solid tumors, simultaneously estimating and adjusting for both tumor ploidy and nonaberrant cell admixture. This allows calculation of “ASCAT profiles” (genome-wide allele-specific copy-number profiles) from which gains, losses, copy number-neutral events, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) can accurately be determined. In an early-stage breast carcinoma series, we observe aneuploidy (>2.7n) in 45% of the cases and an average nonaberrant cell admixture of 49%. By aggregation of ASCAT profiles across our series, we obtain genomic frequency distributions of gains and losses, as well as genome-wide views of LOH and copy number-neutral events in breast cancer. In addition, the ASCAT profiles reveal differences in aberrant tumor cell fraction, ploidy, gains, losses, LOH, and copy number-neutral events between the five previously identified molecular breast cancer subtypes. Basal-like breast carcinomas have a significantly higher frequency of LOH compared with other subtypes, and their ASCAT profiles show large-scale loss of genomic material during tumor development, followed by a whole-genome duplication, resulting in near-triploid genomes. Finally, from the ASCAT profiles, we construct a genome-wide map of allelic skewness in breast cancer, indicating loci where one allele is preferentially lost, whereas the other allele is preferentially gained. We hypothesize that these alternative alleles have a different influence on breast carcinoma development.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Van Loo","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Nordgard","given":"Silje H."},{"family":"Lingjærde","given":"Ole Christian"},{"family":"Russnes","given":"Hege G."},{"family":"Rye","given":"Inga H."},{"family":"Sun","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Weigman","given":"Victor J."},{"family":"Marynen","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Zetterberg","given":"Anders"},{"family":"Naume","given":"Bjørn"},{"family":"Perou","given":"Charles M."},{"family":"Børresen-Dale","given":"Anne-Lise"},{"family":"Kristensen","given":"Vessela N."}],"citation-key":"vanlooAllelespecificCopyNumber2010","container-title":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","container-title-short":"Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A","DOI":"10.1073/pnas.1009843107","ISSN":"0027-8424","issue":"39","issued":{"date-parts":[[2010,9,28]]},"page":"16910-16915","PMCID":"PMC2947907","PMID":"20837533","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Allele-specific copy number analysis of tumors","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2947907/","volume":"107"},

The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour1,2,3. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70–80% of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it4,5. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date6,7,8,9,10,11,12 allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients, and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases (‘poor prognosis’ signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Veer","given":"Laura J.","non-dropping-particle":"van 't"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Hongyue"},{"family":"Vijver","given":"Marc J.","non-dropping-particle":"van de"},{"family":"He","given":"Yudong D."},{"family":"Hart","given":"Augustinus A.

  {"id":"veroliAutomatedFittingProcedure2015","abstract":"In cancer pharmacology (and many other areas), most dose-response curves are satisfactorily described by a classical Hill equation (i.e. 4 parameters logistical). Nevertheless, there are instances where the marked presence of more than one point of inflection, or the presence of combined agonist and antagonist effects, prevents straight-forward modelling of the data via a standard Hill equation. Here we propose a modified model and automated fitting procedure to describe dose-response curves with multiphasic features. The resulting general model enables interpreting each phase of the dose-response as an independent dose-dependent process. We developed an algorithm which automatically generates and ranks dose-response models with varying degrees of multiphasic features. The algorithm was implemented in new freely available Dr Fit software (sourceforge.net/projects/drfit/). We show how our approach is successful in describing dose-response curves with multiphasic features. Additionally, we analysed a large cancer cell viability screen involving 11650 dose-response curves. Based on our algorithm, we found that 28% of cases were better described by a multiphasic model than by the Hill model. We thus provide a robust approach to fit dose-response curves with various degrees of complexity, which, together with the provided software implementation, should enable a wide audience to easily process their own data.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Veroli","given":"Giovanni Y.

  {"id":"wangFDAApprovedEmergingNext2021","abstract":"A patient’s response to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is a complex quantitative trait, and determined by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Three currently FDA-approved predictive biomarkers (progra1mmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1); microsatellite instability (MSI); tumor mutational burden (TMB)) are routinely used for patient selection for ICI response in clinical practice. Although clinical utility of these biomarkers has been demonstrated in ample clinical trials, many variables involved in using these biomarkers have poised serious challenges in daily practice. Furthermore, the predicted responders by these three biomarkers only have a small percentage of overlap, suggesting that each biomarker captures different contributing factors to ICI response. Optimized use of currently FDA-approved biomarkers and development of a new generation of predictive biomarkers are urgently needed. In this review, we will first discuss three widely used FDA-approved predictive biomarkers and their optimal use. Secondly, we will review four novel gene signature biomarkers: T-cell inflamed gene expression profile (GEP), T-cell dysfunction and exclusion gene signature (TIDE), melanocytic plasticity signature (MPS) and B-cell focused gene signature. The GEP and TIDE have shown better predictive performance than PD-L1, and PD-L1 or TMB, respectively. The MPS is superior to PD-L1, TMB, and TIDE. The B-cell focused gene signature represents a previously unexplored predictive biomarker to ICI response. Thirdly, we will highlight two combined predictive biomarkers: TMB+GEP and MPS+TIDE. These integrated biomarkers showed improved predictive outcomes compared to a single predictor. Finally, we will present a potential nucleic acid biomarker signature, allowing DNA and RNA biomarkers to be analyzed in one assay. This comprehensive signature could represent a future direction of developing robust predictive biomarkers, particularly for the cold tumors, for ICI response.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ye"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Zhuang"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wenhua"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Weizhen"},{"family":"Buzdin","given":"Anton"},{"family":"Mu","given":"Xiaofeng"},{"family":"Yan","given":"Qing"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Xiaowen"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hui-Hua"},{"family":"Duhon","given":"Mark"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Gexin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Hong"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xinmin"}],"citation-key":"wangFDAApprovedEmergingNext2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Oncology","DOI":"10.3389/fonc.2021.683419","ISSN":"2234-943X","issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"page":"2115","source":"Frontiers","title":"FDA-Approved and Emerging Next Generation Predictive Biomarkers for Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Cancer Patients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fonc.2021.683419","volume":"11"},

  {"id":"westMultidrugAdaptiveTherapy2019","abstract":"A new ecologically inspired paradigm in cancer treatment known as “adaptive therapy” capitalizes on competitive interactions between drug-sensitive and drug-resistant subclones. The goal of adaptive therapy is to maintain a controllable stable tumor burden by allowing a significant population of treatment sensitive cells to survive. These, in turn, suppress proliferation of the less fit resistant populations. However, there remain several open challenges in designing adaptive therapies, particularly in extending these therapeutic concepts to multiple treatments. We present a cancer treatment case study (metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer) as a point of departure to illustrate three novel concepts to aid the design of multi-drug adaptive therapies. First, frequency-dependent “cycles” of tumor evolution can trap tumor evolution in a periodic, controllable loop. Second, the availability and selection of treatments may limit the evolutionary “absorbing region” reachable by the tumor. Third, the velocity of evolution significantly influences the optimal timing of drug sequences.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,9]]},"author":[{"family":"West","given":"Jeffrey"},{"family":"You","given":"Li"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jingsong"},{"family":"Gatenby","given":"Robert A."},{"family":"Brown","given":"Joel"},{"family":"Newton","given":"Paul K."},{"family":"Anderson","given":"Alexander R.

Additional data supporting the clinical validity of cfDNA-based testing is necessary to inform optimal use of these assays in the clinic. The FoundationOne®Liquid CDx assay is a pan-cancer cfDNA-based comprehensive genomic profiling assay that was recently approved by FDA. Validation studies included >7,500 tests and >30,000 unique variants across >300 genes and >30 cancer types. Clinical validity results across multiple tumor types are presented. Additionally, results demonstrated a 95% limit of detection of 0.40% variant allele fraction for select substitutions and insertions/deletions, 0.37% variant allele fraction for select rearrangements, 21.7% tumor fraction for copy number amplifications, and 30.4% TF for copy number losses. The limit of detection for microsatellite instability and blood tumor mutational burden were also determined. The false positive variant rate was 0.013% (approximately 1 in 8,000). Reproducibility of variant calling was 99.59%. In comparison with an orthogonal method, an overall positive percent agreement of 96.3% and negative percent agreement of >99.9% was observed. These study results demonstrate that FoundationOne Liquid CDx accurately and reproducibly detects the major types of genomic alterations in addition to complex biomarkers such as microsatellite instability, blood tumor mutational burden, and tumor fraction.

  {"id":"worhunskyLeiomyosarcomaOneDisease2015","abstract":"Background Leiomyosarcoma (LMS) can originate from the retroperitoneum, uterus, extremity, and trunk. It is unclear whether tumors of different origin represent discrete entities. We compared clinicopathologic features and outcomes following surgical resection of LMS stratified by site of origin. Methods : Patients with LMS undergoing resection at a single institution were retrospectively reviewed. Clinicopathologic variables were compared across sites. Survival was calculated using the Kaplan–Meier method and compared using log-rank and Cox regression analyses. Results From 1983 to 2011, 138 patients underwent surgical resection for LMS. Retroperitoneal and uterine LMS were larger, higher grade, and more commonly associated with synchronous metastases. However, disease-specific survival, recurrence-free survival, and recurrence patterns were not significantly different across the four sites. Synchronous metastases (HR 3.20, P < 0.001), but not site of origin, size, grade, or margin status, were independently associated with worse DSS. A significant number of recurrences and disease-related deaths were noted beyond 5 years. Conclusions Although larger and higher grade, retroperitoneal and uterine LMS share similar survival and recurrence patterns with their trunk and extremity counterparts. LMS of various anatomic sites may not represent distinct disease processes based on clinical outcomes. The presence of metastatic disease remains the most important prognostic factor for LMS. J.

  {"id":"yadavSearchingDrugSynergy2015","abstract":"Rational design of multi-targeted drug combinations is a promising strategy to tackle the drug resistance problem for many complex disorders. A drug combination is usually classified as synergistic or antagonistic, depending on the deviation of the observed combination response from the expected effect calculated based on a reference model of non-interaction. The existing reference models were proposed originally for low-throughput drug combination experiments, which make the model assumptions often incompatible with the complex drug interaction patterns across various dose pairs that are typically observed in large-scale dose–response matrix experiments. To address these limitations, we proposed a novel reference model, named zero interaction potency (ZIP), which captures the drug interaction relationships by comparing the change in the potency of the dose–response curves between individual drugs and their combinations. We utilized a delta score to quantify the deviation from the expectation of zero interaction, and proved that a delta score value of zero implies both probabilistic independence and dose additivity. Using data from a large-scale anticancer drug combination experiment, we demonstrated empirically how the ZIP scoring approach captures the experimentally confirmed drug synergy while keeping the false positive rate at a low level. Further, rather than relying on a single parameter to assess drug interaction, we proposed the use of an interaction landscape over the full dose–response matrix to identify and quantify synergistic and antagonistic dose regions. The interaction landscape offers an increased power to differentiate between various classes of drug combinations, and may therefore provide an improved means for understanding their mechanisms of action toward clinical translation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Yadav","given":"Bhagwan"},{"family":"Wennerberg","given":"Krister"},{"family":"Aittokallio","given":"Tero"},{"family":"Tang","given":"Jing"}],"citation-key":"yadavSearchingDrugSynergy2015","container-title":"Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","container-title-short":"Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal","DOI":"10.1016/j.csbj.2015.09.001","ISSN":"2001-0370","issued":{"date-parts":[[2015,1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"504-513","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Searching for Drug Synergy in Complex Dose–Response Landscapes Using an Interaction Potency Model","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2001037015000422","volume":"13"},

  {"id":"yuanAccurateInferenceTumor2020","abstract":"Inference of absolute copy numbers in tumor genomes is one of the key points in the study of tumor genesis. However, the mixture of tumor and normal cells poses a big challenge to this task. Accurate estimation of tumor purity (i.e., the fraction of tumor cells) is a necessary step to solve this problem. In this paper, we propose a new approach, AITAC, to accurately infer tumor purity and absolute copy numbers in a tumor sample by using high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. In contrast to many existing algorithms for estimating tumor purity, which usually rely on pre-detected mutation genotypes (heterogeneity and homogeneity), AITAC just requires read depths (RDs) observed at the regions with copy number losses. AITAC creates a non-linear model to correlate tumor purity, observed and expected RDs. It adopts an exhaustive search strategy to scan tumor purity in a wide range, and chooses the tumor purity that minimizes the deviation between observed RDs and expected ones as the optimal solution. We apply the proposed approach to both simulation and real sequencing data sets and demonstrate its performance by comparing with two classical approaches.

Quantitative pharmacology is a discipline that learns and confirms the key characteristics of new molecular entities in a quantitative manner, with goal of providing explicit, reproducible, and predictive evidence for optimizing drug development plans and enabling critical decision making. Model-based drug development serves as an integral part of quantitative pharmacology. This work reviews the general concept, basic elements, and evolving role of model-based drug development in quantitative pharmacology. Two case studies are presented to illustrate how the model-based drug development approach can facilitate knowledge management and decision making during drug development. The case studies also highlight the organizational learning that comes through implementation of quantitative pharmacology as a discipline.
