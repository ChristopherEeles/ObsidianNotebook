## Inference after latent variable estimation for single-cell RNA sequencing data

**Problem:**
  * Differential molecular phenotype analysis between groups learned from the training data fails to control the Type I error rate at alpha
  * This is due to use of information from the training set, namely a learned latent varaible, to generate your Null hypothesis of no difference between the groups
  * Subsequent statistical tests do no meet the independence assumption and thus their interpretation loses its meaning
