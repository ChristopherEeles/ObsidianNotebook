```ad-note
The (Hill-2) equation is for the Hill-Langmuir equation (receptor-ligand) not the Hill equation (agonist-response) and these two cases are related by not equivalent.
```

Although this reaction is mathematically possible, it is not physically possible due to the necessity of intermediate states for any case where $n > 1$.
