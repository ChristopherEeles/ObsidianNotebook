# Ligand-Binding Cooperativity

For situations where a receptor has more than one binding site, co-operativity is the effect that the binding of one ligand has on the probability of binding for a subsequent ligand to that receptor. 

Let $n$ be the co-coperativity coefficient of a ligand-receptor binding reaction. For cases when $n = 1$, the binding is said to be non-cooperative (_i.e.,_ the probability of ligand binding the receptor is constant).

Consider the reactions:



### Positive Cooperativity


#### Negative Cooperativity
