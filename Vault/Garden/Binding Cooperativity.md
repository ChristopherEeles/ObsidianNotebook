# Ligand-Binding Cooperativity

For situations where a receptor has more than one binding site, co-operativity is the effect that the binding of one ligand has on the probability of binding for a subsequent ligand to that receptor. 

Let $n$ be the co-coperativity coefficient of a ligand-receptor binding reaction. For cases when $n = 1$, the binding is said to be non-cooperative (_i.e.,_ the probability of ligand binding the receptor is constant).

Consider the reactions:

Where:
* $K_d$ is the coefficient of dissociation for each reaction step ($K_d \equiv \frac{k_1}{k_2}$; where $k$ is the rate constant for one reaction direction)

The case where $n=1$ is generally considered for receptors with only a single binding site, but would also be valid for the receptors with multiple binding sites which statisify

### Positive Cooperativity

Binding of one ligand increases the probability of subsequent ligand binding to the receptor, $n \gt 1$. Satisfies  $\large K_{d_i} \gt K_{d_{(i + 1)}}$ for each subsequent binding step in the reaction.

### Negative Cooperativity
Binding of one ligand decreases the probability of subsequent ligand binding to the receptor, $n \lt 1$. Satisfies  $\large K_{d_i} \lt K_{d_{(i + 1)}}$ for each subsequent binding step in the reaction.
