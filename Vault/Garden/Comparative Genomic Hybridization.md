# Comparative Genomic Hybridization

## Copy Number CGH[^1]
- Original implementation:
	- Flourescently labelled DNA from a "test" and "reference" are cohybridized to normal metaphase chromosomes; ratio of intensities is proportional to the copy numbers of the corresponding DNA sequences in the test and reference genomes
	- Use of metaphase chromosome limits resoution to ~20 Mb
- Probe based implementation (Array CGH):
	- Hybridize to array of mapped sequences (probes) increases resolution relative to metaphase chromosomes
