# Operational Model of Agonism

### Operational Model of Agonism[^1]

- Developed by Black and Leff to help understand the action of agonists and partial agonists
	- To develop systematic way to measure relative agonist efficacy based on examination of dose-response curves

- Assumes:
	- Agonists bind receptors acording to the law of mass action
	- System is at equillibrium
	- $\ce{[A] >> [R_T]}$; the agonist is in excess of the receptor
$$\LARGE \ce{[AR] = \frac{[R_T][A]}{[A] + K_A}} \tag{OMA-1}$$
- Where:
	- $\ce{[R_T]}$ is total receptor concentration
	- $\ce{K_A}$ is the agonist-receptor equillibrium dissociation constant

- What is the relationship between $\ce{[AR]}$ and response?
	- Don't always know the biochemical details (_.e.g,_ mechanism unknown)

### Black Box Problem[^2]
- Relationship between concentration of activated receptor and biological effect is unknown (a black box)
$$\LARGE \ce{E = z([AR]) = z\left(\frac{[R_T][A]}{K_A + [A]}\right)}$$
- Where $\ce{z}$ is some monotonic function relating receptor concentration to observed biological effect (_i.e.,_ phenotype)
