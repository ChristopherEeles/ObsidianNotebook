# Log2-Ratio

## Copy Number from SNP-CGH Arrays[^1][^2]
- SNP-CGH can measure both signal intensity variations (Log2-Ratio; L2R) and allelic composition (B-Allele Frequency; BAF)
- Two major methods to compute:
	- Single sample: intensity ratio via canonical genotype clusters from reference samples
	- Paired-sample: intensity ratio vs normal tissue from same sample
-
