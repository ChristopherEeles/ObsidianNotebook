# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
* In a convolutional layer, neurons are not connected to all elements of their layer (contrast with a dense layer)
	* Instead they have a "receptive field" of adjacent neurons they connect to
* All neurons in a given layer share their set of weights over all receptive fields
	* Weights represent a mask or filter which detects specific patterns within each layer
	* Additional convolutional layers can assemble basic patterns into complex feature representations
